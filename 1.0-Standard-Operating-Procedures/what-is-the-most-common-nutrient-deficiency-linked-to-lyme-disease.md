# What is the most common nutrient deficiency linked to Lyme disease?

In Lyme disease, spirochete microbes can severely impair vitamin D receptors, reducing immune function despite normal blood levels. Key points:- Impact: Spirochetes weaken vitamin D receptors by 50 to 80 times, hindering immune response against the microbe.- Broader Implications: Similar receptor issues occur with other pathogens and cancers, often missed in standard blood tests.- Prevalence: About 30% of individuals, particularly overweight people, may have vitamin D receptor issues worsened by factors like darker skin, age, low cholesterol, seed oil consumption, and smoking.- Strategies: Enhance vitamin D function with intermittent high-dose supplementation, sunlight, omega-3s, resveratrol, exercise, quercetin, zinc, boron, progesterone, sulforaphane, and TUDCA to counteract resistance and support immune health.Understanding these challenges helps tailor approaches to optimize vitamin D effectiveness and address receptor-related issues effectively.
