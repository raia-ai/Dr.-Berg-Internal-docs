# What is the recommended diet for heart disease?

Causes of Heart Attack:1. Clogged Coronary Artery – It abstracts the blood flow to the heart muscle. There is always some type of damage or inflammation beforehand happening in the wall of the coronary artery – then the body starts accumulating cholesterol, protein, and calcium as a Band-Aid which causes it to start developing plaques, clot and if it became big enough, it can either dislodge or stop the flow of the artery which couldn’t supply oxygen to the muscle tissue. The cause of inflammation is high levels of insulin and low nutrients.2. Arrhythmia – problem with the pacemaker, the rhythm of the heart is off and blood can pull in different parts of the heart which could develop a clot and the clot could spread and clog an artery. Potassium and magnesium are the nutrients that control the rhythm of the heart.3. Heart Muscle (Muscle Cramps) – vitamin E has a very specific purpose of increasing oxygen in the heart muscle. But if you are low in vitamin E, the heart has to work harder and it will have a tendency to cramp up which could lead to angina and heart attack.*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-best-diet-for-heart-disease-or-heart-attack-diet-for-heart-patients-drberg
