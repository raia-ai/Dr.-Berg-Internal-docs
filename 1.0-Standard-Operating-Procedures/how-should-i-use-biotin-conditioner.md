# How should I use Biotin Conditioner?

After washing, massage a dime-sized amount of conditioner into your scalp and work through your hair until itâ€™s fully coated. Then rinse out completely. You can apply more product as needed. For best results, pair with Dr. Berg Biotin Shampoo before each use.
