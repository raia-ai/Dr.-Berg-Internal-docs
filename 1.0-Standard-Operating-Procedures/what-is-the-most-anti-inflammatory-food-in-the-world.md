# What is the most anti-inflammatory food in the world?

When considering anti-inflammatory foods, especially in relation to conditions like autoimmune disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, and various forms of arthritis, itâ€™s essential to recognize that many inflammatory conditions begin in the gut. Among the most potent anti-inflammatory agents is the amino acid glutamine, known for its remarkable ability to heal and support gut health. Glutamine plays a crucial role in reducing inflammation by repairing the gut lining, making it one of the most effective tools for managing inflammation at its source.
