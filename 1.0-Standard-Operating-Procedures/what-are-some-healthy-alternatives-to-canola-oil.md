# What are some healthy alternatives to canola oil?

While canola oil is not banned across Europe, itâ€™s important to be aware of its potential health risks.Nutritional Advantages of Olive Oil:- Heart Health: Rich in monounsaturated fats, olive oil helps lower LDL (bad) cholesterol while raising HDL (good) cholesterol. It also contains antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols that protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. - Research Support: A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that extra-virgin olive oil reduces the risk of cardiovascular events by 30% compared to a low-fat diet. Choosing cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil ensures the highest nutritional value.Health Benefits of Coconut Oil:- Quick Energy: High in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), coconut oil provides quick energy and may aid in weight management by increasing satiety. - Heart and Immune Health: It contains lauric acid, which has antimicrobial properties and promotes heart health by increasing HDL cholesterol.Incorporating olive or coconut oil into your diet offers significant health benefits while avoiding the potential risks associated with canola oil.
