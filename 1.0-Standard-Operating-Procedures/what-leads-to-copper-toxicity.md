# What leads to copper toxicity?

Copper toxicity is primarily caused by environmental exposure, such as unbound copper ions in drinking water. However, toxicity can also occur from taking contraceptive pills or having a copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD). In addition, taking supplements with high concentrations of copper or having a zinc deficiency can also lead to copper toxicity, as zinc competes with copper for intestinal absorption.
