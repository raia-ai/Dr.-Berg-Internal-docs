# What is the difference between TUDCA and the Gallbladder Formula Extra Strength?

The primary difference between TUDCA and Dr. Berg's Gallbladder Formula Extra Strength lies in their composition and specific health benefits:TUDCA (Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid):Composition: TUDCA is a water-soluble bile acid, which is a component of bile salts. It is naturally occurring and can also be synthesized.Health Benefits: TUDCA has been used traditionally and in modern supplements for its benefits to the liver, gallbladder, nervous system, and digestive system. It helps reduce gallbladder sludge, lower the risk of gallstones, support nervous system function, improve insulin sensitivity, aid digestion, and manage cholesterol levels.Dr. Berg's Gallbladder Formula:Composition: This formula supports overall gallbladder health and improves digestion. It focuses on enhancing bile synthesis and addressing symptoms of bile deficiency, such as bloating and discomfort after meals.Health Benefits: The formula benefits those without a gallbladder or those looking to boost their digestive health. It aids in breaking down fats and helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins, promoting digestive harmony and vitality.In summary, while TUDCA is specifically a bile acid with broad health benefits, Dr. Berg's Gallbladder Formula Extra Strength is a comprehensive supplement to improve gallbladder function and digestive health. Dr. Berg recommends taking one TUDCA on an empty stomach in the morning. Dr. Berg suggests that the Gallbladder Formula is best taken right after the last bite of a meal to help with digestion.
