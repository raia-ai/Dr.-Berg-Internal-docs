# Is it advisable to drink water while eating?

If you’re going to drink water with your meal, add apple cider vinegar to the water to help you keep the body pH where it needs to be. Avoid adding calcium carbonate or drinking alkaline water with the meal because it will dilute stomach acid.But then, what’s more important is what you are eating or the quality of food you are consuming. Don’t force yourself to drink a lot of water, especially when you eat protein— because potentially, it can also dilute the HCL and weaken the ability to break down protein. If you are eating a salad with a meal or combining it with protein, you can find that you are thirstier at the end of the meal because the high quantity of fiber in the salad attracts water and gels up the colon, so the body will tell you that it needs a little more water.
