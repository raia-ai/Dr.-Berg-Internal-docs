# What causes poor memory function?

Canola Oil and Cognitive HealthRecent studies suggest that high consumption of canola oil may impair memory and promote inflammation, increasing the risk of cognitive decline and neurological disorders. - Memory Impairment: Mice on a high-canola oil diet showed significant working memory impairments due to changes in synaptic integrity and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.- Cognitive Performance: Higher vegetable oil intake, including canola, is linked to poorer cognitive performance in older adults, suggesting a risk for age-related mental deterioration and dementia.- Inflammation: Canola oil's inflammatory properties may contribute to chronic diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.RecommendationsTo support brain health, consider healthier oils such as olive or coconut oil, which may reduce the risk of memory impairment and provide additional health benefits.
