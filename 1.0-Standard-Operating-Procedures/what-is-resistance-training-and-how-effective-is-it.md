# What is resistance training, and how effective is it?

Resistance training, which involves using weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight to challenge your muscles, is crucial for muscle hypertrophy, the process of muscle growth.This type of training creates microscopic tears in your muscle fibers, which your body then repairs and rebuilds stronger during rest and recovery.When engaging in resistance training, focus on compound movements that work for multiple muscle groups simultaneously.These exercises are not only efficient but also stimulate a greater hormonal response, leading to enhanced muscle growth. Some effective compound exercises include:SquatsDeadliftsBench PressOverhead PressPull-UpsRowsIncorporate these exercises into your training program, aiming for 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions per exercise. As you get stronger, progressively overload your muscles by increasing the weight, reps, or sets to continue challenging your body and promoting muscle growth.
