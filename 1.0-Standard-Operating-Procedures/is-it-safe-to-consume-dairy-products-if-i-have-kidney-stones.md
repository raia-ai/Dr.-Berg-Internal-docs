# Is it safe to consume dairy products if I have kidney stones?

Some studies show that you should consume dairy as it helps you reduce kidney stones. When you consume it, calcium in the dairy binds with calcium in the digestive tract and then there’s less binding going on in the kidney through the blood.But the problem is, a lot of people have allergies to the proteins in the milk called casein and whey, and some people are also sensitive to lactose (the sugar in milk).Most of the cows in the market consume grains even if they’re organic, non-GMO or without pesticides, so in many dairy products you are still going to have higher omega-6 fatty acids compared to omega-3 and that could increase inflammation.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/should-you-eat-dairy-calcium-with-kidney-stones-food-for-kidney-stones-drberg
