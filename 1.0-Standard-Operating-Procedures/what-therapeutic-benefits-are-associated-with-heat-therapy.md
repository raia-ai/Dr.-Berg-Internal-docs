# What therapeutic benefits are associated with heat therapy?

Heat therapy is really good for chronic conditions—especially chronic injuries. However, if you recently had an injury where there’s inflammation, and you put heat on it, it’s going to make it worse. In that situation, you need to use cold therapy.Many chronic diseases cause the accumulation of certain proteins that are non-functional and tend to clog things up. Heat therapy can help prevent this from happening. Additionally, you can add intermittent fasting.
