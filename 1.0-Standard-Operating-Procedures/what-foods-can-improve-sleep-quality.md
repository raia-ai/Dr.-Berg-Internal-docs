This involves both boosting its production and avoiding factors that suppress it.Here's how to create the ideal sleep environment:Temperature: Keep your bedroom cool, between 60 and 69 degrees Fahrenheit, as warmer temperatures can decrease melatonin.Eating Habits: Avoid large meals close to bedtime, especially if practicing intermittent fasting. Consider having your last meal at lunchtime.Light Exposure: Minimize exposure to blue light from electronic devices in the evening. Instead, get sunlight during the day to boost vitamin D and melatonin production.Additionally, avoid EMF waves, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, certain medications, high-carb diets, and exercise before bed, as these can all hinder melatonin.Incorporate these 5 foods to boost melatonin and enhance sleep quality:Tart Cherries: Rich in melatonin and tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin and then melatonin, tart cherries have been shown to increase sleep duration significantly.Kiwis: High in serotonin, kiwis have been linked to improved sleep quality, duration, and ease of falling asleep.Fatty Fish: Salmon, tuna, and trout are excellent sources of melatonin.Kefir: This probiotic-rich drink, similar to yogurt, can be blended with berries for a sleep-promoting snack.Sauerkraut: Packed with beneficial microbes and tryptophan, sauerkraut can improve sleep.
