This can be linked to kidney health, diabetes, and insulin resistance.Gout TriggersGout attacks often occur at night after consuming:Alcohol (especially beer)Meat & SeafoodOrgan MeatsFructose (a type of sugar)Other Factors:pH and Temperature: Acidic body pH and cooler temperatures (like in your toes) can increase the likelihood of crystal formation and flare-ups.Potential Gout Remedies:CeleryCoffee (moderate intake: 1 cup per day)Tart CherryLemonMore Vegetables, Moderate ProteinImportant Note on Fasting: Fasting can temporarily increase uric acid levels.
