# Can I safely drink a lot of black tea?

Black tea has large amounts of tannins. A tannin is a chemical that inhibits the absorption of vitamin B1. Some kinds of tea, like green tea, are low in tannins.But, consuming a lot of black teas, like English Breakfast tea and many others, can deplete you of vitamin B1 because theyâ€™re high in tannins.
