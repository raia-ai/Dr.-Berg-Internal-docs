# Which is healthier: cow's milk or sheep's milk?

Sheep milk cheese is healthier than most cow milk cheese and is better tolerated and utilized in the human body.Most cow milk cheese contains A1 casein, which is actually a genetic mutation. A1 casein allows a harmful peptide known as BCM-7 into the digestive tract, which can cause digestive issues. The A2 casein found in sheep milk cheese does not cause this problem.
