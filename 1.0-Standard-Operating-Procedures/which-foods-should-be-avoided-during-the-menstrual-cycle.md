# Which foods should be avoided during the menstrual cycle?

I explain the relationship between dairy and your menstrual cycle. It comes down to the hormone estrogen in dairy. Many people already have too much estrogen; we’re swimming in a sea of it! A lot of pesticides and insecticides mimic estrogen. They’re called endocrine disruptors or estrogen disruptors.So if you already have excess estrogen, and you’re consuming a product with additional hormones because it’s meant for a growing calf, it can create some issues. Not only with the menstrual cycle but also your breast tissue, uterus, and ovaries. And you men, it can cause prostate issues too.Many people are lactose intolerant; they don’t have the enzyme to break down milk sugar, so they get digestive issues. Or they may have a casein allergy that’s causing digestive issues, particularly to either the A1 or A2 protein in casein. You may want to try cheese from a goat or a sheep, which has less A1 protein.During the menstrual cycle, it's beneficial to avoid dairy products due to their estrogen content. Dairy often contains additional hormones intended for calf growth, which can exacerbate existing estrogen levels in the body. This surplus of estrogen may contribute to issues with the menstrual cycle, as well as affect breast tissue, uterus, and ovaries. For those sensitive to dairy, lactose intolerance or allergies to casein (specifically A1 or A2 proteins) can also lead to digestive discomfort. Opting for dairy from goats or sheep, which typically have less A1 protein, or ensuring dairy comes from grass-fed or organic sources can mitigate these concerns. Additionally, considering the diet and living conditions of dairy cows can impact the quality and hormone content of milk, with organic and naturally bred cows often being preferable choices.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/dairy-menstrual-cycle-female-hormone-high-estrogen-foods-to-avoid-during-menstruation-drberg
