# What causes Addison's disease?

What causes Addison's? There are three primary things:1. Tuberculosis - Around 25% of the population has TB. However, it can remain dormant until later in life. I recommend 20,000 IUs of vitamin D to combat TB2. Fungus - Certain funguses can cause cortisol levels to drop. This often goes unnoticed.3. Stress and trauma - Both mental and physical stress can cause Addison's disease. Stressors can cause the adrenals to shut down or becomes overwhelmed. I recommend using acupressure to help the adrenal glands function properly. Just to the right of the belly button, use your thumb and middle finger to apply pressure. This will help relieve and extract stress.*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/adrenal-insufficiency-and-low-cortisol-symptoms-causes-solutions-drberg
