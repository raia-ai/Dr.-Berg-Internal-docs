# We understand the triggers for hiccups, but what causes them at a deeper level?

Hiccups are often triggered by an imbalance in oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, where excessive oxygen intake disturbs the normal exchange of gases in the body. This disrupts the release of oxygen from red blood cells to tissues, as carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in facilitating this process. The resulting physiological disruptions, such as hiccups, highlight the intricate balance necessary for efficient respiratory and cellular function.
