# What should I do if I experience gallbladder issues while intermittent fasting?

Symptoms of gallbladder issues include:• Gastritis• Pain in the right shoulder area• Pain or tightness in the area under your right ribcage• Burping Gallbladder issues are often related to your bile (or lack thereof).Gallstones or gallbladder sludge develops as the cholesterol concentration in your gallbladder increases. When your body begins to burn fat for fuel from fasting or the ketogenic diet, your body releases triglycerides and cholesterol. This may cause your cholesterol to increase in your gallbladder, which may lead to bile sludge. Preexisting gallbladder or liver issues, bile deficiencies, and a poor gut microbiome can contribute to gallstones and bile sludge. Over time, many gallbladder issues will resolve themselves while you’re fasting and doing keto. While fasting, the best remedy for bile sludge is to take purified bile salts. This will help increase your bile and decrease the concentration of cholesterol and triglycerides. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/gallbladder-problems-and-prolonged-fasting
