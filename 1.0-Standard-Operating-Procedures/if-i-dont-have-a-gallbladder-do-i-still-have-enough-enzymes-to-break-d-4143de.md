# If I don't have a gallbladder, do I still have enough enzymes to break down protein?

When the gallbladder is removed, the body may experience a reduction in concentrated bile, impacting the breakdown of fats and fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K, as well as omega-3 fatty acids. Supplementing with bile salts or a gallbladder formula can aid in compensating for this deficiency. Monitoring for loose stools or diarrhea can indicate excess bile intake, while constipation may suggest insufficient bile. Striking a balance is essential for optimal digestion and nutrient absorption.
