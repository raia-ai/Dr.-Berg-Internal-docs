# What are some less obvious causes of anemia that might be overlooked?

H. pylori is a type of bacteria that most of the population already has. When the timing and environment are just right, H. pylori can come out of remission and create all sorts of problems.H. pylori primarily causes issues like gastritis, ulcers, and stomach atrophy. It typically comes out of remission when the stomach loses acidity. Some people are also more susceptible to getting an H. pylori infection. H. pylori bacteria also have unique survival mechanisms that help them thrive. One of these mechanisms leads to iron and B12 deficiencies. If you’re taking vitamin B12 and iron for anemia and it’s not helping, it could be because the real problem is in the stomach.The typical treatment for H. pylori is months of antibiotics. But, if you develop antibiotic resistance to H. pylori, they won’t work anymore. Antibiotics can also have side effects. We need to look at alternatives to get rid of H. pylori naturally.The best natural alternatives:1. Take natural antibiotics (sulforaphane and wormwood extract)2. Support your stomach by taking zinc3. Take betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar (if gastritis, inflammation, and ulcers are non-existent)4. Take a probiotic or consume probiotic foods (sauerkraut and pickles)*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.
