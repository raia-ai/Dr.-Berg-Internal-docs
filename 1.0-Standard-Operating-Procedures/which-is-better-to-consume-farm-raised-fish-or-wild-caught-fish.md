# Which is better to consume: farm-raised fish or wild-caught fish?

Many people wonder if wild-caught fish is worth the price tag—the answer is yes, it is! Wild-caught fish is superior to farm-raised fish and definitely worth the investment in your health.Farm-raised fish are fed a terrible diet that reflects in their nutritional value. Farm-raised fish are fed corn meal, soybean meal, and canola meal, all of which are GMO and contain glyphosate residue. They’re also fed wheat, fish meat, and animal by-products from animals who were fed a GMO diet. Depending on where the fish is farmed, they may be given antibiotics and PCBs. Farm-raised fish contain 3x the omega-6 fatty acids as wild-caught fish and only half of the omega-3s. Omega-6 fatty acids are highly inflammatory, especially when they outnumber omega-3 fatty acids.
