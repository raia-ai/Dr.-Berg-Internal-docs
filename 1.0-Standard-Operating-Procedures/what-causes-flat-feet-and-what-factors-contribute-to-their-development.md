# What causes flat feet, and what factors contribute to their development?

Flat fleet means that your feet donâ€™t have the arch that they should have. When this arch is nonexistent or significantly flattened, it can cause pain and discomfort.What could be the cause?My opinion is that either a manganese deficiency or vitamin D deficiency at birth can set up a child with a weakened structure of the arch or a bone malformation.You can massage the side opposite to the flat foot, which will stimulate it, making the body give relaxation signals to the bottom part of the foot. I want to provide you with some simple techniques to relieve the strain on the muscles of your foot so as to prevent and manage pain due to flat feet.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-to-fix-flat-feet-best-stretch-exercise-drberg
