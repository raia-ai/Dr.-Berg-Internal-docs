# What are the main factors that contribute to inflammation?

Inflammation Triggers:1. Food Allergies (Dairy, Nuts, Gluten): Can inflame specific body parts like the gut.2. Insulin Resistance (Sugar): Hidden sugars in foods like juice and bread cause joint stiffness and pain.3. Cortisol (Autoimmune): Low cortisol levels or resistance can lead to inflammation; consider natural cortisol support like licorice root.4. Old Injuries: Intermittent fasting may reduce inflammation from past injuries.5. Infection: Herbal antibiotics such as cloves, oregano, and garlic can help combat infections.6. Oxidants (Free Iron): Excessive sugar, junk food, and alcohol can cause oxidative damage to the brain and arteries.7. Alcohol: Liver damage from alcohol consumption contributes to inflammation.8. Omega 6 (Corn, Soy): GMO-derived products are highly inflammatory.9. Raw Nuts (Seeds): Enzyme inhibitors in raw nuts can affect gallbladder function and digestion.10.
