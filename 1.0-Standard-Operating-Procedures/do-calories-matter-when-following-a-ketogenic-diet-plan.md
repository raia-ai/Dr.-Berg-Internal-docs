# Do calories matter when following a ketogenic diet plan?

nstead of focusing solely on calorie counting, consider these factors: your metabolic rate, thyroid function, insulin resistance, exercise, stress, sleep quality, and overall health. Eating a Healthy KetoÂ® diet and gradually reducing meal frequency from three to two, then to one meal a day (OMAD), can help regulate calorie intake. Listen to your body's hunger cues to determine the right amount of calories for you. As for feeling sleepy after eating salad, it could be due to overwhelming gut bacteria or hidden sugars in dressings. Gradually reduce salad intake to avoid fatigue and allow your body to adapt to increased vegetable consumption. This approach emphasizes overall health and satisfaction over strict calorie counting.
