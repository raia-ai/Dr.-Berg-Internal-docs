# Why do I keep getting styes repeatedly?

Ever wonder why styes keep popping up on your eyelid? It's not just about bad luck. These pesky lumps often reappear due to several factors, including poor hygiene and underlying health conditions. The main culprit is often Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria that thrives around the eye area and causes inflammation in the oil glands at the base of eyelashes. To combat this, ensure you wash your hands before touching your eyes and regularly clean any makeup tools. Underlying health issues like diabetes, rosacea, or blepharitis can also contribute to recurring styes, so managing these conditions is crucial to reducing their occurrence. Additionally, a diet lacking in vitamins A or D may increase susceptibility to styes, as these nutrients are essential for immune function and eye health. Incorporating foods rich in these vitamins can help support overall eye health and reduce the likelihood of styes.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/stye-fixed
