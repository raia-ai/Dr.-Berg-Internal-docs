# What is the most effective treatment for acid reflux?

Natural remedies for acid reflux or heartburn include apple cider vinegar, which helps balance stomach acidity, and betaine hydrochloride, which supports proper digestion. Incorporating natural probiotics like whole-milk kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi can also aid digestion by promoting a healthy microbiome in the gut, reducing the likelihood of bacterial overgrowth that can exacerbate reflux symptoms. These remedies support overall digestive health, addressing underlying factors contributing to acid reflux.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/use-probiotics-for-acid-reflux
