# What is the best time to drink Electrolyte Powder?

The best time of the day to take electrolyte powder, specifically Dr. Berg's electrolyte powder, is in the morning. This recommendation is based on the idea that taking electrolyte powder in the morning can help provide a good amount of energy throughout the day. Additionally, taking it before bed might lead to frequent urination during the night due to its effect on flushing out excessive fluid. Therefore, consuming it in the morning is generally advised to avoid nighttime disturbances and make the most of its energy boost.
