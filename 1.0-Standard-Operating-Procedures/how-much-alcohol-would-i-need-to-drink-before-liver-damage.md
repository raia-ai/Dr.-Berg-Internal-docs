# How much alcohol would I need to drink before liver damage?

One study found that just 21 binge drinking sessions could potentially produce early-stage liver disease. In this study, a binge drinking session is classified as more than five drinks in two hours, and a drink is classified as 0.6 ounces of alcohol.0.6 ounces of alcohol is equivalent to: • 12 oz of beer • 8 oz of malt liquor • 5 oz of wine • 1.5 oz shot of liquorWhen you have an alcoholic drink, about 25% of the alcohol is absorbed into your bloodstream. As it goes through the bloodstream, it goes through the liver. The liver then breaks it down and deals with the toxic material.Over time, you will lose the enzyme network that breaks down the toxic material. The toxic material can then build up and create a lot of damage. This can lead to fat in the liver, inflammation, and eventually cirrhosis. Inflammation in the liver usually starts within five years of heavy drinking on a regular basis. Cirrhosis typically takes 5 to 10 years or more to develop. Eventually, you can lose liver function. This can cause an inability to detox, leading to digestive problems, DNA damage, and a higher risk of liver cancer. But, you won't experience many symptoms until things progress.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-much-alcohol-would-you-have-to-drink-before-liver-damage
