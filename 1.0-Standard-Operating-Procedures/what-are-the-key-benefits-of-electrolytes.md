# What are the key benefits of electrolytes?

1. Sodium: • Hydrates • Is involved in oxygen transport • Works with potassium to generate electrical potential (the sodium-potassium pump) • Decreased sodium can lead to weakness, tiredness, and low endurance 2. Potassium: • Supports the nerve and muscle interaction • Works with sodium to generate electrical potential (the sodium-potassium pump) • Decreased potassium can lead to weakness and tiredness3. Magnesium: • Controls the absorption of sodium and potassium • Is associated with oxygen • Supports the relaxation of the muscle • May help prevent muscle cramps • May be necessary for workouts (especially long or intense workouts) • Decreased magnesium may lead to muscle cramps and low endurance 4. Calcium: • Supports muscle contraction • Supports neuromuscular excitability • Decreased calcium can lead to tetany, muscle cramps, and skeletal muscle weakness 5. Chloride: • Supports hydration https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-does-an-electrolyte-do
