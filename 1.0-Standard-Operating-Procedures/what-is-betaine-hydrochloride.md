# What is betaine hydrochloride?

Betaine hydrochloride, a natural amino acid found in foods like beets, spinach, beef, and shrimp, helps manage conditions such as SIBO by increasing stomach acid to prevent pathogen overgrowth in the small intestine. It supports digestion, aids in nutrient absorption (including vitamin B12 and minerals), and activates protease enzymes essential for breaking down protein into amino acids. It's beneficial for GERD and acid reflux but should not be taken with calcium, which neutralizes stomach acid.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-is-betaine-hcl-drberg-explains-how-to-use-it
