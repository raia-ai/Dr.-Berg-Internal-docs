# What can cause peripheral neuropathy?

Peripheral neuropathy is a condition where you experience tingling, numbness or burning- type pain in the bottoms of your feet or in your fingertips. This sensation starts from the fingers and toes and can extend further.Symptoms (in the bottom of your feet or your fingertips):TinglingNumbnessBurning painCirculation problemCause #1: Diabetes and too much sugarIf you are diabetic, which is caused by a high-carb diet, it can clog up and starve the tiny blood vessels that are connected to your nerves. These blood vessels are very vital for your nerve channels to function properly. Once your nerve ends donâ€™t receive needed nutrients anymore (from these little blood vessels), they stop functioning-- causing peripheral neuropathy symptoms.Cause #2: Vitamin B1 and B12 deficiencyVitamin B1 and B12 are very important for the healthy function of your nerves and nervous system in general. If you are deficient in them, this can cause short-circuiting of the electric flow in the nerves. This, in combination with diabetes, can cause peripheral neuropathy.
