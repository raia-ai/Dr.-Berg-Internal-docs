# Is it possible to build muscle while fasting?

Sometimes people think they need to spike insulin to gain muscle mass. They load up on carbs because carbs trigger insulin, and insulin is an anabolic hormone. But, when you stimulate insulin too much, you create insulin resistance. If you have insulin resistance, you can’t absorb protein or amino acids that well. What to do to help gain muscle mass: 1. Do 2 meals a day (do intermittent fasting for at least 16 hours) 2. Get enough exercise 3. Don’t go over 50g of carbs (if you’re younger, you may be able to go up to 70g) 4. Consume 6-8 oz. of complete protein per meal (egg and fish are good) 5. Get your nutrients (calcium, B vitamins, magnesium, vitamin D, potassium) A few things that can slow down muscle gain or cause muscle loss: 1. Cortisol 2. Long fasts (72 hours) 3.
