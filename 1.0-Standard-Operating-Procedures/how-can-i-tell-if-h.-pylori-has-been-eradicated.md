# How can I tell if H. pylori has been eradicated?

Managing Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) involves addressing potential ulcers and gastritis, focusing on achieving remission rather than complete eradication due to its common presence. Factors like stress can exacerbate inflammation by altering benign bacteria into opportunistic strains. Restoring stomach acidity and optimizing diet are pivotal in symptom improvement and promoting gut health. For personalized advice on H. pylori management and enhancing gastrointestinal wellness, consulting a healthcare provider is recommended.
