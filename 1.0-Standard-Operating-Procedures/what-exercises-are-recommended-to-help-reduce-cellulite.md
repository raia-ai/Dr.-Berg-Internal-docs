# What exercises are recommended to help reduce cellulite?

Cellulite isn’t a special type of fat. It actually has to do with your muscles. Underneath your skin, you have a superficial layer of fat. Right underneath your fat, you have muscles. When your muscles haven’t been toned properly, they begin to atrophy. In other words, your muscles are shrinking, which causes sort of an orange peel effect, where you get cellulite dimples.The problem is, many people with cellulite go to the gym and do machine exercises. These are very two-dimensional forms of exercise. What you need are three-dimensional workouts. The lower part of your body has 90 different muscles. When you work out, you need to activate all 90. Unfortunately, machine workouts just don’t do the trick.The best exercises for cellulite will activate all of these muscles. I have a great routine that will do just that.
