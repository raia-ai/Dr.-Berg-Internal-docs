# What are the potential long-term risks of chronic laxative use, and how can it impact gastrointestinal health?

Well, I guess laxatives could be dangerous because a few possible dangers of laxatives are: • They could be addictive • They could deplete electrolytes (In this case, you would want to just add the electrolytes back)The dangers of having chronic constipation are way worse than the minor dangers of using laxatives. If you have constipation, as a coping mechanism, take an herbal natural laxative like cascara sagrada. This should give you constipation relief while you figure out what’s causing the constipation. Natural constipation remedies: • MCT oil • Bile salts • Vitamin B1 • Probiotic • Fasting • Adjust fiberhttps://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/are-laxatives-for-chronic-constipation-dangerous-for-long-term-drberg
