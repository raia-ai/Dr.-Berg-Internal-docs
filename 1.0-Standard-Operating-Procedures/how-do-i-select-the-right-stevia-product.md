# How do I select the right stevia product?

Choosing the Right Stevia ProductChoosing the Right Stevia ProductWhen selecting a stevia product, it’s crucial to avoid those with additives like maltodextrin or sugar, which can counteract stevia’s benefits and impact blood sugar levels.Avoid AdditivesMany stevia products include additives for texture or sweetness. Maltodextrin, in particular, has a high glycemic index and can cause blood sugar spikes. Always read labels to ensure the product is free from these additives.Opt for Pure SteviaChoose plain stevia extracts or powders, which contain only purified steviol glycosides and no fillers. These products offer the purest form of stevia, providing maximum benefits with minimal impact on blood sugar. Use sparingly, as stevia’s intense sweetness means a little goes a long way.
