# What benefits does magnesium stearate provide in the Magnesium Glycinate?

Magnesium Stearate (vegetable source) Magnesium stearate, even from a vegetable source, is generally considered a safe and common additive in supplements. Improved Flow and Machinability: Magnesium stearate acts as a lubricant or "flow agent." It prevents the powdery ingredients in a capsule from sticking together during the manufacturing process. This ensures smooth operation of the machines that fill the capsules and helps maintain consistent capsule quality. Separation Prevention: It can also help prevent the ingredients from separating within the capsule, ensuring even distribution throughout the dosage. Generally Considered Safe: The FDA considers magnesium stearate, even from a vegetable source, to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food and dietary supplements.
