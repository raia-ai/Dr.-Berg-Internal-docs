# Whatâ€™s the best way to gain muscle while following OMAD?

To bulk up with OMAD (One Meal A Day), focus on intense strength training with heavy weights and low reps to stimulate muscle growth. While keto and intermittent fasting can help preserve muscle, effective bulking requires consistent exercise and a well-planned diet. Ensure your single meal provides sufficient protein and calories to support muscle repair and growth.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/intermittent-fasting-and-muscle-mass-gain-drberg
