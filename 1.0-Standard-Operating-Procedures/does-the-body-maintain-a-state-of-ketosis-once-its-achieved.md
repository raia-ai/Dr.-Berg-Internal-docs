# Does the body maintain a state of ketosis once itâ€™s achieved?

If your ketone strips indicate the presence of ketosis, it is likely that you are indeed in a ketogenic state. However, even a minor intake of carbohydrates can trigger insulin release, which may shift your metabolism back to utilizing glucose for energy. Therefore, maintaining a low carbohydrate intake is crucial for sustaining ketosis.The body naturally regulates blood sugar levels, and an increase in carbohydrate consumption can disrupt this state. Initially, urine tests can be useful for monitoring ketosis; however, as your body adapts and becomes more efficient at burning ketones, the amount of ketones excreted in urine may decrease. Consequently, blood tests are generally considered a more reliable method for confirming ketosis once you have fully adapted to the ketogenic diet.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-is-ketosis-drberg
