# What treatments and remedies are effective for reducing or improving the appearance of acne scars?

https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/best-way-to-rid-acne-scarsIf you have scarring from acne, I believe one of the best things you can do is to use vitamin E oil. When using vitamin E oil for acne scars on your face, you may want to use organic hexane-free vitamin E oil. Vitamin E can have a significant effect on fibrosis. It may actually help break down scar tissue. Benefits of vitamin E for the skin:• It’s a powerful antioxidant• It’s fat-soluble (it goes into the skin)• It’s an anti-inflammatory • It can help break down scar tissue • It can help with certain wrinkles To use vitamin E oil for your skin, rub it into the skin for about one or two minutes right before you go to bed every night for about two or three weeks. To kick things up a notch, you may want to combine the use of vitamin E oil with the healthy keto diet, intermittent fasting, and periodic prolonged fasting. This combination might give you even better results because consuming a lot of carbs can block the effect of vitamin E and can make the skin age faster. When you do fasting, especially prolonged fasting, your body goes through autophagy, which is a fantastic anti-aging action. You may want to do prolonged fasting once every two weeks or once a month for at least 72 hours.
