# What are the effects of not getting enough magnesium?

Magnesium is vital for over 300 bodily functions, including energy production and muscle relaxation. Deficiency can stem from low dietary intake, processed foods, inflammation, and certain substances like phytates. Signs include muscle cramps, fatigue, and high blood pressure. Calcium buildup due to magnesium deficiency poses risks like heart attacks and inflammation. Vitamin K2, zinc, vitamin D, and boron can complement magnesium in preventing harmful calcification. Always consult a healthcare professional for proper assessment and guidance.
