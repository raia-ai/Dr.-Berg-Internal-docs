# Quality checklist before sending responses

## Overview

Use this checklist before sending ANY customer response (email, chat, SMS, phone follow-up) to ensure quality, accuracy, and professionalism.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Did I address the customer's actual question?

Check:

* Re-read the customer's message
* Confirm you answered what they asked (not what you assumed they asked)
* If they asked multiple questions, did you answer ALL of them?

Common Mistake:

* Customer asks: "When will my order ship?"
* Bad response: "Our shipping policy is here: \[link]"
* Good response: "Your order #12345 will ship today and arrive in 1-2 business days. Tracking: \[link]"
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Is my information accurate?

Verify:

* Order numbers, tracking numbers, dates
* Product names, prices, links
* Policy details (30-day return, shipping times, etc.)
* Dr. Berg's content (don't make up what he says)

If unsure:

* Check the knowledge base
* Ask a supervisor
* Don't guess or make assumptions
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Did I use the customer's name?

Personalization matters:

* ✅ "Hi Sarah," or "Hi Sarah Jones,"
* ❌ "Hi," or "Hello,"

Exception:

* If customer didn't provide name, use "Hi there," or "Hello,"
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Is my tone appropriate?

Match the situation:

* Happy customer → Friendly, enthusiastic
* Neutral inquiry → Professional, helpful
* Frustrated customer → Empathetic, apologetic, solution-focused
* Angry customer → Calm, understanding, de-escalating

Empathy phrases:

* "I understand how frustrating this must be..."
* "I'm so sorry you're experiencing this..."
* "I appreciate your patience..."
* "I can see why you'd be concerned..."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Did I provide a solution or next step?

Every response should include:

* What you're doing to help
* What the customer should expect next
* Timeline for resolution (if applicable)

Examples:

* ✅ "I've processed your refund. You'll receive $50 within 5-7 business days."
* ✅ "I'm escalating this to our QA team. They'll reach out within 24 hours."
* ❌ "I understand your concern." \[No solution provided]
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Did I include relevant links or resources?

Helpful links:

* Product pages
* Tracking links
* Policy pages (return, shipping)
* Dr. Berg's YouTube videos (if relevant)
* Support portal

Make links clickable:

* ✅ "Track your order here: https://tracking.ups.com/12345"
* ❌ "You can track your order at the UPS website"
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Did I avoid making promises I can't keep?

Be careful with:

* "I guarantee..."
* "This will definitely..."
* "You'll receive it by..."
* "This product will cure..."

Use instead:

* "Typically..."
* "Most customers experience..."
* "Estimated delivery is..."
* "This product supports..."

Never promise:

* Specific health outcomes
* Exact delivery dates (beyond carrier estimates)
* Refunds/exceptions you're not authorized to approve
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Did I include medical disclaimer (if needed)?

Add disclaimer if:

* Discussing health conditions
* Recommending supplements for specific issues
* Customer mentions medications
* Customer describes symptoms

Disclaimer template:

> "Please note: This information is educational and not medical advice. For personalized recommendations, especially if you have medical conditions or take medications, please consult your healthcare provider."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Is my response clear and concise?

Check for:

* Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
* Bullet points for lists
* No jargon or confusing language
* Proper grammar and spelling

Too long?

* If over 600 characters for live chat, consider breaking into multiple messages
* If email is over 300 words, see if you can simplify

Too short?

* Make sure you fully answered the question
* Add helpful context if needed
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Did I end with a closing question?

Always ask:

* "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
* "Do you have any other questions?"
* "Would you like me to help you with anything else?"

Why?

* Shows you're available for more help
* Prevents multiple back-and-forth messages
* Improves customer satisfaction
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

***

{% hint style="danger" %}
Red Flags - DO NOT SEND if:

* You're not sure if the information is correct → Verify first, then respond
* You're feeling frustrated or annoyed → Take a break, then respond with fresh perspective
* The customer is asking for medical advice → Use medical disclaimer template, don't provide advice
* You're making promises you can't keep → Revise to be realistic and honest
* You're about to send a template without customization → Personalize it first
* The response doesn't actually solve the problem → Add a clear solution or next step
* You're unsure how to handle the situation → Ask a supervisor before responding
{% endhint %}

## Remember

Quality over speed.

It's better to take an extra 2 minutes to send a high-quality response than to rush and send something that:

* Doesn't answer the question
* Contains errors
* Requires multiple follow-ups
* Frustrates the customer

Every response represents Dr. Berg's brand. Make it count!
