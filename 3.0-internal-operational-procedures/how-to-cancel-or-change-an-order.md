# How to cancel or change an order

## Overview

This SOP explains when and how orders can be cancelled or modified, and what to do when it's too late.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important Policy

We cannot cancel or change orders once they reach our warehouse.

This means:

* Orders placed during business hours may reach the warehouse within 1–2 hours
* Orders placed on weekends will be processed Monday morning
* Once in warehouse system, orders cannot be stopped
{% endhint %}

## Step-by-Step Process

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Check Order Status

Ask the customer for their **order number** and check the system.

Possible statuses:

* Order Status: "Open" or "Pending"
  * Order has NOT reached warehouse yet
  * Cancellation MAY be possible
  * Proceed to the next step
* Order Status: "Processing" or "Shipped"
  * Order has reached warehouse or already shipped
  * Cancellation is NOT possible
  * Proceed to the final step (Refund Option)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### If Order is Still "Open" or "Pending"

1. Contact warehouse team immediately:
   * Email: orders@drberg.com
   * Subject: "URGENT: Order Cancellation Request - Order #\[number]"
   * Include: Customer name, order number, reason for cancellation
2. Inform customer: "I've submitted an urgent cancellation request to our warehouse team. However, I cannot guarantee we'll be able to stop the order before it ships. If we're unable to cancel it, you can request a refund once you receive the package, and you won't need to return it."
3. Follow up with customer within 24 hours with confirmation.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### If Order Cannot be Cancelled

Inform the customer: "I apologize, but your order has already reached our warehouse and cannot be cancelled or modified at this stage. However, once you receive the package, you can request a full refund within 30 days, and you won't need to return the product. Would you like me to help you with anything else?"
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Common Scenarios

<summary>Customer wants to change shipping address</summary>

* If order is still "Open":

  2. Include: Order number, old address, new address
  3. Inform customer it may not be possible if already processed
* If order is "Processing" or "Shipped":
  * Cannot change address
  * Customer must contact shipping carrier (UPS/USPS) directly with tracking number

</details>

<details>

<summary>Customer wants to add items to order</summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Customer wants to change product/size/flavor</summary>

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
Important Notes

* Weekend orders: Processed Monday morning, so cancellation requests submitted on weekends have higher success rate
* Business day orders: Very short window (1–2 hours) to catch orders before warehouse processing
* No partial cancellations: Cannot cancel individual items from multi-product orders
{% endhint %}

## Customer Communication Templates
