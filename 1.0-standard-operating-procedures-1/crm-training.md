How to create and process a manual Work Item?

Overview

Besides the automatically created Work Items that are created by the system when loading information and allocating work from other Dr. Berg websites and processes, the CRM users can also create a Work Item manually. Available Work Item Types for this can be configured in Manage Work Item Types page. Work Item Types manually added from this page will have Category as "Manually Created". Preset Work Item Types for this include "Support Ticket" and "Product Info Query".

These Work Items are usually created when there is specific request or certain issue from the Contact that requires the Rep to keep track of or to follow-up. A Work Item should be created in such case so that all related interactions between the Rep and Contact associated with the issue can be gathered in one place for tracking and reference.

Design

Sample

Following information and functions are available in the Reference tab of a manually created Work Item:

1. Work Item Type explanation: this is the description for the purpose of the Work Item Type which is specified by the Admin in Manage Work Item Types page
2. Work Item Note: Since this Work Item is manually created, no data from other systems or processes is available, but there is a text area that allows the Rep to quickly put in some notes or reminders regarding the Work Item
   1. This field is resizable by clicking and dragging the icon in the bottom right corner of the text area
   2. The text entered in the box will be automatically saved and can be quickly edited
3. FAQ Request:
   1. There is question from Contact that is not directly submitted as FAQ Request from Main Website but through some email/ SMS/ Voice correspondence with the Consultant in other Work Item (Support Ticket, Product Info Query or other manually created Work Item Types).\
      In this case, the Consultant working on the Work Item can submit an FAQ Request to Admin if they find the question is frequently asked/ popular enough for an KB\&R entry.
   2. This function is applied for the purpose of enriching the KB\&R materials for better tracking the general interests of the Contacts in order to build better and more effective correspondence between CRM Reps and Contacts.
   3. Process:
      1. Click the FAQ Request button to open the pop-up where Rep can enter the question and proposed answer
      2. Once the request is submitted, related information will then show in the Work Item Reference (similar to FAQ Request Work Items)
      3. FAQ Request submitted by the CRM Rep would appear in Manage KB\&R page with Requested By = Rep Name with links to the CRM Contact record and the Work Item for Admin to better identify this case.

Proposed Process

1. There are several places for the Rep to create a manual Work Item:
   1. From WORK ITEM tab in Contact Detail page: click following icon to open the Create pop-up
   2. From a Contact interaction in INBOX:
   3. From the CALLSLAT when there is incoming/outgoing Contact call:
2. Newly created Work Item would be in Status of NEW
3. The next process for this Work Item Type would be similar to the general suggested process in [What are Work Items and how do you use them?](https://support.drberg.com/articles/what-are-work-items-and-how-do-you-use-them)

NOTE: this is just a proposed flow to process the manually created Work Item, depending on the specific situation, the Rep can alter/ adjust this process to suit the practical working case.

How to Create Company Announcements and/or Product Alerts

This video shows how an Admin or Manager can add Company Announcements and/or Product Alerts to the CRM.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://www.screencast.com/users/TonyCiotti/folders/Snagit/media/bbb0a406-b638-48e1-a5c3-0f88e7d7561d/embed)

How to do a Fraud Review

We suspect that we are getting a lot of false positives on the fraud detections from BlueSnap. Therefore, we are starting to put these orders on hold, while we review the merits of the fraud warnings. If we feel it is actually a good customer that was mistakenly tagged as fraud, we will contact that customer and get the order put through.

This article will cover two areas:

1. How to use the CRM for managing the Fraud Review Work Items, and
2. How to use Magento to do further research on the customer and how to place an order through Magento.

How to use the CRM for managing the Fraud Review Work Item

Communication Tools

* Use the CRM for all communications with customers (email, phone and text).
* Use your @drberg.com email account to communicate with BlueSnap.
* Use Microsoft Teams to collaborate with internal team members (or the internal chat feature in CRM if you find the individual online).

We will use Teams to collaborate internally on the Fraud Review Work Items. Use the Sales Team Channel for communicating and make sure you use "@" to tag the individuals you want to collaborate with. This will ensure they are notified that you are chatting with them.

In addition to using Teams for chatting, we will also use the Files tab for sharing files. The main file we will be sharing is the Fraud Review spreadsheet that lists the fraud reviews that we are working on.

Fraud Review Steps

1. Search for email address in CRM.
2. Update "In CRM?" field in spreadsheet.
3. If not in CRM, go to the next email address, otherwise continue with the following steps.
4. Create Fraud Review WI if email in CRM.
   1. Select "Fraud Review" Work Item Type.
   2. Enter "BlueSnap on \[transaction date from spreadsheet]"
   3. Assign the work item to yourself.
5. Copy Fraud Review URL form CRM to spreadsheet.
6. Reassign Abandoned Shopping Cart to yourself, so other Reps do not call it during Fraud Review.
7. Research, send email to BlueSnap and send email to customer, as needed to resolve.
   1. Resolve/Close Fraud Review WI and Abandoned Cart WI.

Video training on the above process steps

How to Enter Clockify Hours

The Payroll Department needs to enter in the Approved Hours (aka "Clockify Hours") into the CRM so the hourly pay can be calculated correctly in the CRM.

This video demonstrates how that is done.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://www.screencast.com/users/TonyCiotti/folders/Snagit/media/d82f34fe-91f6-40a1-aa8e-5bb236d1a1dd/embed)

How to link Order Id to Calls

Overview

The Customer might call to the CRM for various enquiries including helping with ordering products. Also, during outbound calls in reaching back to the Customer, Dr. Berg Advisors might be asked to help ordering. For those calls, the CRM Rep can add the Magento Order Id to the call interaction so that they can be stored for reference as well as for reporting purpose, such as tracking inbound source for Sales.

How to link Order Id to Call interaction

1. During the Inbound/ Outbound Call, in the Call Slat, there is a text field with the placeholder saying "Enter Order Id". The CRM Rep after creating the Order in Magento can copy the Order number and paste to this field.\
   Once they click Save Note in the Callslat, the Linked Order Id would be added to the call interaction as following.
2. In case CRM Rep forgets to enter the Order ID or enters the wrong Id and wants to update that, they can click the "Linked Order" tag in the call interaction to view details and edit the number if needed.
3. Note: the Edit function would only be available for the call interaction's author and Admin users.
4. Magento Linked Order pop-up would show when the User clicks on the tag, showing further details regarding the Order Id validation

Linked Order ID Validation

To prevent the CRM Rep from entering wrong information, there is a system's automatic validation process running daily at 2 AM ET to update the validation result based on pre-defined logic to the specified Order ID.

1. At first, when the Order ID is just entered/ updated, it would be showed as "Pending for validation" and the tag would be in grey as pending indication.
2. After the validation process, the Linked Order ID would be showed as Valid (in green) or Invalid (in Red).
   1. In general Valid Order Id should be the Order created by the Consultant who made the sale call within the \[call duration + 2 hours]
   2. There are several reasons causing a Linked Order ID to be tagged as Invalid:
      1. No existing Order associated with the specified ID
      2. The Order is under other Rep's Name
      3. The Order's created date does not fall on acceptable time range (call duration + 2 hours)
      4. The Order Id is added to more than 1 Call interaction.
   3. For existing Order ID, there is "View Order in Magento" button to open the Order view in Magento site in another browser tab
3. Technical Notes: the validation process would run daily after the Magento Customer and Order Sync, on the specified linked Order in "Pending for validation" and "Invalid".

How to Mark a Message as "Read"

Messages do not automatically move from "Read" to "Unread" by opening the message and reading them. The user needs to click the email icon, in order to tell the system that you would like the message moved into your "Read" tab, which is really your Message Archive.

If you hover over the "unread email icon", it will tell you "Mark as Read". If you click it, then it will move the message from Unread to Read tab.

If you hover over the "read email icon", it will tell you "Mark as Unread". If you click it, then it will move the message from Read to Unread tab.

\[OLD] How to process an Abandoned Shopping Cart Work Item?

Overview

In Dr. Berg Shop site, the customer might add products to their shopping cart then leave them there for various reasons. The CRM is programmed to run a scheduled process to scan through the Shop site to check for the abandoned carts of offline customers and create the corresponding Work Items named "Abandoned Shopping Cart" , which are then assigned to correct Reps for figuring out the reason and helping customer processing the cart, thus, increasing the sales productivity.

Design

Sample

Following information is available in the Reference tab of Abandoned Shopping Cart Work Item:

1. Shopping Account Id: the Id of the Shop site Customer account that the cart belongs to\
   Since a CRM contact can have multiple email addresses which are linked to different Shop site accounts, this information is provided to better identify the cart
2. Total number of products in the cart: this counts the number of items in the cart regardless of product types
3. Cart created date and last updated date
4. Detailed products information: including
   1. Product preview image and name with hyperlink to open the view of that product in the Shop Site
   2. SKU, Price, Quality in the cart and Subtotal amount
5. Cart's total value
6. Functional buttons:
   1. Sync button: this is showing the latest date time when the cart info is loaded from Shop site, the Rep can click this button to trigger another information synchronization.
   2. Manage Cart in Magento: to open the Abandoned Cart view in Shop site - Admin access for further processing in this site

Note: in case the Work Item has been closed (set to inactive Status of Closed/ Resolved or Sold), the reference will show following information: Date time, when the cart was last updated, Linked Magento Order (if any) and the specified reason for closing the Work Item.

Proposed Process

1. The CRM will run the scheduled process every 30 minutes to load a maximum of 50 records at a time. This will check the Cart's Updated Date in the Shop site to decide which carts to import and to have Work Items created for.
   1. If the cart's related customer information matches a CRM Contact then the Work Item will be added to such Contact and appear in the Inbox/ Unread of assigned Rep.
   2. If there is no matching CRM Contact found, the CRM will create new Contact record, using Shop SIte customer account information and add the Work Item to such Contact, which then also appear in the assigned Rep's Inbox/ Unread.
2. Newly created Work Item will be in NEW Status.
3. The Rep can change Work Item Status to IN PROGRESS when start working on the Work Item (sending follow-up email/ call, etc.)
4. The Rep can change the Status to PENDING if expecting reply from the Contact.
5. If the Contact is following Rep’s consultation on processing the Cart, the Rep can change the Status to SELLING for following up with this. As Order is created for the cart, the Rep can change the Work Item Status to SOLD, indicating the result of such Work Item.
6. If there is no reply/ feedback from Contact for a long time, the Consultant can change the Work Item Status to CLOSED then (assuming the contact has no interest in completing the cart).

NOTE: this is just a proposed flow to process the Abandoned Shopping Cart Work Item, depending on the specific situation, the Rep can alter/ adjust this process to suit the practical working case.

What are Work Items and how do you use them?

Overview

Work Items are used for both Prospects and Customers, but in this article I will just refer to Customers for sake of brevity.

Customers need work done, such as sending them product information, explaining their quiz results, fixing problems with shopping cart, fixing billing issues, fixing shipping issues, etc. Employees need a way to know that Customers have requested work to be done and need a way to track the progress of those requests. Generically, we call these requests Work Items.

These Work Items are mostly triggered from Call-to-Actions in marketing emails, from the website or other interactions the customer has with the various Dr. Berg websites. Typically, the customer will click a button which shows a Request Form that they fill out and submit.

The CRM is programmed to run a scheduled update to pull these records from other Dr. Berg websites into the CRM. The CRM then automatically turns these requests into Work Items that can be assigned to the correct employee for handling.

Alternatively, if the customer calls or sends an email directly to the CRM system, the CRM user can manually create a work item (Support Ticket type, or Product Info Query type, or others as set in Admin/ Manage Work Item Types page), from that verbal or emailed request.

How It Works

1. Access:
   1. Automatically created Work Items would be loaded to the CRM following a scheduled process and assigned to the Reps based on predefined routing logic. The Work Items will then show up in the Assigned Rep's Inbox:
      1. If this is a New Lead (meaning this contact is not already in our database) then the system will automatically create a Contact and load the Work Item to such Contact. Work Item will then show up in the Unread section of the Inbox.
      2. If this Work Item is from an Existing Contact (meaning this contact is already in our database) then the Work Item will show up in the Unread section of the Inbox.
      3. Note: Since the quantity of Work Items, especially those from quiz takers in Main Websites, is significantly large for each Rep everyday, we do not want this to overshadow other important interactions such as missed calls, incoming emails, SMS. Thus, for "All Entities" filter in the Inbox, the Unread and Read would only show communication interactions (calls, emails, sms). The User needs to select "Work Items" to see the list of Work Items assigned to them. Moreover, there is a filter applied for this view that by default, only the High priority Work Item Types would be showed up. The User needs to select other filter to see their needed Work Items in the list then.
   2. From the Inbox, you can navigate to the Customer's Detail page or directly to the Customer's Work Item. From the screenshot below, you can see there are two hyperlinks in each inbound message: Work Item hyperlink, and Customer hyperlink.
      1. If you click the "Body Type Quiz" or "Health Evaluation Quiz" hyperlinks in this example, you will be redirected directly to those specific Work Items.
      2. If you click "Sarah Bays", "Abdulrahman Alz", or "Cathy Slater" hyperlinks in this example, you will be redirected directly to those specific Customer Detail pages.
   3. From the Contact Detail page, the Rep can view the list of associated Work Items as well as each Work Item details from WORK ITEM tab
2. Design: Basic design of a Work Item is displayed through the Work Item tile (in the list) and Work Item detail section, which is a two-tab panel for viewing information and managing the Work Item.
   1. Work Item tiles: the left section in the WORK ITEM tab of a customer. It lists the Work Items associated to that specific Customer, with some basic information, such as: Work Item Type, Description, Created Date Time, Callback Date Time, Assignee, and Status.
   2. Once a Work Item is selected, you will notice that the left border of the tile will be highlighted, to indicate it is selected. The highlight color will match the status-color code. In the above example, it is highlighted with the color green, which is the color-code for the status of New. Also, by selecting the tile, the detail section to the right of the tile would display the following corresponding information:
      1. Work Item Action: from this tab, the user can view the history of the status changes, as well as reviewing all of the interactions that have occurred between the CRM User and the customer, related to this Work Item. Therefore, this tab is also used to initiate interactions with the customer, such as sending emails and/or SMS messages, making phone calls, setting reminders or taking notes.
      2. Work Item Reference: this tab provides the Rep with personalized and specific information relating to the Work Item. The reference information is specific for the different Work Item Types, so it should provide relevant information the Rep will need to resolve the Work Item. Following is the sample reference of a Body Type Quiz Work Item reference
3. Manage Work Items:
   1. By default, the Work Items list only shows the active Work Items. If you click the filter icon, you can see the filtering options. To the right of the filter icon, you will see two numbers: Number of Filtered Work Items and Number of Total Work Items.
   2. The Rep can use the filter function to see a specific list of Work Items. Available filtering criteria includes Work Item Categories and Work Item Statuses
   3. The Rep can manually created a Work Item, using the create icon.
   4. The Rep can update the information of the Work Item such as Description, Assignee and Status by clicking on edit icon in the bottom right corner of each Work Item tile.
4. Work Item General Proposed Process: Depending on the Work Item type as well as practical working scenario, the process to handle a Work Item might vary. However, the general one would be
   1. Newly created Work Item would be in Status of NEW
   2. Once the Rep starts to work on the Work Item, change the Status to IN PROGRESS\
      At this point, the Rep would be analyzing the information and request in the Work Item then work on contacting the Prospect/ Customer for consultation/ feedback or other assistance.\
      NOTE: if the Rep needs to review Contact's Shop site related information, click SYNC WITH MAGENTO button in Status & Marketing panel to get the most updated information pulled over to the CRM.
   3. While waiting for the Contact's reply, the Rep can change the Work Item Status to PENDING, indicating this state of the Work Item.\
      Note: Contact might call back or send SMS/ Email to the CRM regarding the request for certain Work Item, these interactions will show up in the Rep Inbox as general Contact interaction. If it deems that the interaction should be related to a specific Work Item, the Rep should add this interaction to that Work Item, which then moves the interaction to the Work Item's Action tab. By doing so, all interactions regarding certain Work Item can be kept under such Work Item for later review or reference.
   4. If the contact is pleased with the consultation and does not have further request, the Rep can update the Work Item Status to RESOLVED, indicating that the issue the contact encountered has been successfully handled.
   5. If there is product purchase request, the Rep can change the Status to SELLING for following up with this request. After the Order is created for this, the Rep can change the Work Item Status to SOLD, indicating such result.
   6. In case there is no incoming interaction/ feedback from the contact for a long time OR there is other reason preventing the Work Item from being completed and nothing can be done for that, the Rep can update the Status to CLOSED then.

NOTE: Detailed description and explanation of each specific Work Item Type used in the CRM will be provided in other training articles.
