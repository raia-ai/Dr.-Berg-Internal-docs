### Which L Reuteri Product Should Be Used In The Recipe Fix Your Gut With One Microbe

## Which L. Reuteri Product Should Be Used in the Recipe? - Fix Your Gut With ONE Microbe

Dr. Berg does not recommend any specific brand of L. Reuteri product for Dr. Davis' L. Reuteri Yogurt recipe. However, in Dr. Berg's video [Fix Your Gut With ONE Microbe](https://youtu.be/nZV1oYv5Ddo?si=_te37QJM_DEVK5xQ), Dr. Berg uses the Oxiceutics MyReuteri, and in the video's description, he links to Food for Gut's Lactobacillus Reuteri Probiotic Powder. Dr. Davis uses the BioGaia Gastrus wafer product in Dr. Davis's recipe.

Any of these L. Reuteri products will work to create the L. Reuteri Yogurt. Below is some information on each of the L. Reuteri products:

The BioGaia Gastrus used by Dr. Davis has 2 million CFU of L. Reuteri in each serving/wafer. Dr. Davis uses 10 wafers for each batch of yogurt. One bottle of BioGaia Gastrus has 30 wafers and will yield three batches of yogurt.

The Oxiceutics MyReuteri used in Dr. Berg's video has 20 billion CFU of L. Reuteri in each serving/capsule. One capsule can be opened and used to create a batch of yogurt. One bottle of Oxiceutics MyReuteri has 30 servings and will yield 30 batches of yogurt.

Food for Gut's Lactobacillus Reuteri Probiotic Powder has 37 billion CFU per serving or 1/4 tsp. One 1/4 tsp serving will create a batch of yogurt, and the bottle will make 48 batches of yogurt.

### Why Does Dr Berg Make Videos On Youtube

## Why does Dr. Berg make videos on YouTube?

Dr. Berg started making videos on YouTube in 2009 because he wanted to educate people on the subject of health. He had a chiropractic and health clinic in the Northern Virginia area and realized that he couldn't help everyone he wanted to if he was just seeing one patient at a time. He created his channel and started posting free content so that everyone could have access to health information!
