### Can Adrenal Fatigue Cause Weight Gain

## Can adrenal fatigue cause weight gain?

It depends on how chronic the fatigue is. If you have an issue with chronic stress, as opposed to only having occasional stress events, then there may be some weight gain. It also depends on your diet. If you have a bad diet and chronic stress, the situation is going to be far worse. There's a condition called Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by high cortisol or hypercortisolism. Cortisol is known as the stress hormone, and the adrenal glands are responsible for creating it. It begins gradually and gets worse as time passes. The starting point is adrenal fatigue. Symptoms to look out for include:

• Visceral fat

• High blood pressure

• Round face

• Red cheeks

• Fatigue

• Anxiety

• Buffalo hump

• Fat-collar bone

• Thin skin

• Decreased libido

• Hypokalemia

• Low vitamin D

• Insomnia

### Does Allithiamine Bypass All Transport Mechanisms

## Does Allithiamine bypass all transport mechanisms?

Allithiamine does not bypass all transport mechanisms. It is absorbed through a specialized entry mechanism, which means its absorption is rate-limited and not entirely passive. This indicates that while allithiamine may have a more accessible transport across the intestinal wall than free thiamine, it still relies on specific transport processes rather than completely bypassing them.

Further information can be researched here - [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv1973/22/Supplement/22\_Supplement\_63/\_pdf](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv1973/22/Supplement/22_Supplement_63/_pdf)

***

### Does Allithiamine Require Enzymatic Breakdown

## Does Allithiamine require enzymatic breakdown?

Allithiamine does not need enzymatic breakdown like some other forms of thiamine. It is a lipid-soluble form of vitamin B1, which means it can be absorbed more efficiently and bypass some of the transport mechanisms that regular thiamine requires. This lipid solubility is due to its chemical structure, which includes an allyl disulfide group, allowing it to cross cell membranes more efficiently without needing enzyme conversion.

More information on this topic is available here - [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biochemistry1922/41/1/41\_1\_29/\_pdf](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biochemistry1922/41/1/41_1_29/_pdf)

### Does Dr Bergs Electrolyte Powder Contain Lower Sodium Levels

## Does Dr. Berg's Electrolyte Powder contain lower sodium levels?

**Key Points:**

* **Average Person:** Dr. Berg's electrolyte powder is mainly for people with low potassium levels, not athletes who lose lots of sodium through sweat. It addresses common potassium and magnesium deficiencies.
* **Ideal Ratio:** A 4:1 potassium-to-sodium ratio supports heart health and blood pressure. Most people get enough sodium from their diet, so the powder has only 40 mg of sodium per 1,000 mg of potassium.
* **Different Needs:** Athletes need more sodium replacement due to sweat loss. Sports drinks have about 500 mg of sodium per 1,000 mg of potassium. Dr. Berg's regular powder is for those without high sodium loss.
* **Different Needs:** Athletes need more sodium replacement due to sweat loss. Sports drinks have about 500 mg of sodium per 1,000 mg of potassium. Dr. Berg's regular powder is for those without high sodium loss.
* **Product Choices:**

### Does Electrolyte Powder Fully Dissolve In Water And What Factors Influence Its Solubility And Effect

## Does electrolyte powder fully dissolve in water, and what factors influence its solubility and effectiveness in hydration?

Under certain conditions, our Electrolyte Powder products may not completely dissolve when added to water, a characteristic known as solubility. Unlike many other companies' electrolyte products, our formulation does not contain emulsifying agents. While our natural formula may not fully dissolve, it effectively dissociates its ions and conducts the electricity that electrolytes are known for.

The solubility of electrolyte powders is influenced by several factors, including water properties, heat, and agitation. For optimal results, it's crucial to use purified, deionized water at a temperature range of 20-40˚C or 68-104˚F. A gentle stir is usually sufficient to dissolve the electrolytes, but a vigorous shake in a shaker bottle can expedite the process.

It is best to avoid cold water, as it does not dissolve electrolytes as effectively as warm to hot water. Tap water should also be avoided, as it is often alkaline and may contain some electrolytes. Both of these characteristics will limit the solubility of the Electrolyte Powder.

If you prefer your Electrolyte Powder drink cold, add ice after the powder has dissolved.

### Does Multi Collagen Peptide Supplement Have Daily Value Protein

## Does Multi Collagen Peptide supplement have daily value protein?

Multi Collagen Protein does not have a (%DV) daily value for protein for the following reasons:

* This is because collagen peptides do not have all the amino acids to create a complete protein. Therefore, we are not able to list a daily value. Tryptophan is the missing amino acid from all collagen peptides, not just our product.
* The amino acid profile listed on the packaging is a General/Typical Amino Acid Profile. Each batch will not have the exact amount of amino acids and will not be listed on a Certificate of Analysis. These amounts have been tested from the initial batch, and subsequent batches will have a similar but not exact profile.

Below is information on the type I, II, III, V, and X collagen peptides in our product. **Type I Collagen**   •  Most abundant type in the human body   •  Supports skin, teeth, bones, tendons and ligaments   •  Provides strength to connective tissues **Type II Collagen**   •  Makes up about 90% of cartilage collagen   •  Primary benefit is joint health and support   •  Particularly beneficial for active people who need joint support **Type III Collagen**   •  Found in internal organs, blood vessels, and muscles   •  Usually occurs alongside Type I collagen   •  Present in bone marrow and reticular fibers   •  Important for organ and vessel health **Type V Collagen**   •  Found in skin, nails, hair, and multiple organs, including cornea, bone matrix, muscles, lungs, liver, and placenta   •  Supports eye health and development, particularly the cornea   •  Plays a crucial role in placenta formation during pregnancy   •  Coats the area around hair follicles   •  Supports insulin production through Islet cell function **Type X Collagen**   •  Specialized collagen found primarily in bones and joint cartilage   •  Essential for bone formation and mineralization   •  Acts as a reliable marker for new bone formation in articular cartilage   •  Particularly important during:    \*Bone and cartilage healing after injury    \*Early childhood growth phases    \*Endochondral ossification (bone formation process)

### Does Nutritional Yeast Contain Msg

## Does Nutritional Yeast contain MSG?

Nutritional yeast does not naturally contain MSG. Nutritional yeast will only contain MSG if added to the nutritional yeast.

All Dr. Berg Nutritionals' nutritional yeast products and those containing nutritional yeast are all-natural and do not contain MSG.

Nutritional yeast does contain naturally occurring glutamic acid but is not the same as the synthetic MSG used as a food additive.

Glutamic acid is an amino acid, one of the building blocks of proteins. In its natural form, glutamic acid is not harmful and is an essential component of our diet.

MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. It is a synthetic compound produced through fermentation involving sugar beets, sugarcane, or starch. MSG is known for enhancing the savory or umami taste of foods. It is often used as a food additive to enhance the flavor of various dishes.

### Does Soil Used In Farming Have All The Trace Minerals Your Body Needs

## Does soil used in farming have all the trace minerals your body needs?

Modern farming practices can lead to nutrient depletion in the soil. Often, farmers replenish only a few major minerals, neglecting trace minerals. Consequently, if the soil lacks trace minerals, the plants grown in it will also be deficient. This deficiency carries up the food chain to animals that consume these plants and ultimately to humans who eat these crops and animal products. Therefore, unless one regularly consumes sources like oysters, shellfish, and seafood, it is common to be deficient in trace minerals due to depleted soil.

### Does The Chewable Vitamin C Contain Gum Arabic

## Does the Chewable Vitamin C Contain Gum Arabic?

Gum arabic is used in supplements for several reasons, primarily as an inactive ingredient (also known as an excipient) to improve the formulation and stability of the product:

Binding Agent: In tablets, it helps to bind the active ingredients together, ensuring the tablet holds its shape.

Thickener and Texturizer: It can be used to give a desirable consistency or texture to liquid, chewable, or powdered supplements.

Film Former/Coating Agent: It can be used to coat tablets or encapsulate sensitive ingredients, protecting them from moisture or oxidation and sometimes masking taste.

Source of Soluble Fiber: While typically used in small amounts for its functional properties, gum arabic is also a source of soluble dietary fiber, which can be an added benefit.

Safety Profile: It has a long history of safe use in food and pharmaceuticals and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

In summary, gum arabic is used in supplements as a versatile, natural excipient that helps with the manufacturing process, improves the stability and texture of the final product, ensures consistent dosing, and is well-tolerated.

***

### Does The Daily Value Dv For Biotin On The Multi Collagen Peptide Label Represent A Maximum Or Minimu

## Does the % daily value (DV) for biotin on the Multi Collagen Peptide label represent a maximum or minimum daily intake?

The 200% Daily Value (DV) of biotin on the label means the product provides twice the FDA-recommended daily intake, which is set at 30 micrograms per day for adults. This is not a maximum—it reflects a level considered sufficient to support normal biological functions, such as energy metabolism and the maintenance of healthy skin, hair, and nails.

Importantly, this is not based on an upper limit, and the FDA has not established a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for biotin because it has a strong safety profile, even at doses much higher than what's included in this formula.

The 60 mcg per serving is well within the range of common dietary supplements, many of which contain 1,000 mcg or more, often marketed for cosmetic or metabolic support without safety concerns.

Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning that excess amounts are naturally excreted through urine, and the risk of overstimulation or adverse effects at this level is extremely low in healthy individuals.

The %DV helps consumers understand how a nutrient contributes to their daily intake and is based on minimum recommended levels for general nutritional adequacy, not therapeutic or toxic thresholds.

From the Manufacturer: Nutritional yeast naturally contains the amino acid tyrosine, which can convert into tyramine. However, the level of conversion in our yeast is unknown and likely very low.

Tyramine levels generally increase with longer fermentation processes. Since our nutritional yeast flakes are primarily grown under controlled conditions, the risk of significant tyramine formation is minimal. Additionally, our testing on similar Brewer's yeast products showed either undetectable or very low tyramine levels (< 3 mcg/g).

### Dr Bergs Multi Collagen Peptides Unable To Purchase In Australia Best Practices

## Dr. Berg's Multi Collagen Peptides - Unable to Purchase in Australia - Best Practices

Dr. Berg has formulated an amazing Multi Collagen Product. Unfortunately, due to its animal-derived ingredients, Australia has banned the import of the product into the country. While we don’t have a specific brand recommendation, here are some best practices to help you choose a high-quality collagen supplement with similar benefits, while our Multi Collagen Peptides are unavailable in Australia

Match the collagen types – Look for a blend that includes Types I, II, III, V, and X, ideally from grass-fed bovine and wild-caught sources.

Added nutrients – Collagen works best when paired with vitamin C and biotin to support absorption and benefits for skin, hair, and joints.

Clean and certified – Choose products that are third-party tested, non-GMO, glyphosate-free, and free from artificial fillers.

Locally sourced – Australian-made products ensure freshness and often follow strict quality standards, while adhering to local requirements.

Mixability and taste – Unflavored or lightly flavored collagen powders that dissolve easily make daily use more convenient.

### I Have Not Changed My Meals Or Routine But My Niacin Flush Has Been Different Every Day Why Is That

## I have not changed my meals or routine but my niacin flush has been different every day - why is that?

Variability in the body’s response to niacin is common, and it often has more to do with internal or environmental factors than with the supplement itself.

Even though the meal may have been the same each day, digestion can vary. Things like gut motility, enzyme activity, stomach acid, and even the microbiome can change day to day, which can affect how quickly or strongly niacin is absorbed and processed. Stress, hydration levels, hormone fluctuations, how well someone slept, or what else is happening in the body at the time can impact how niacin affects someone. Niacin sensitivity can build over several days of use, making flushes more or less intense or over time, even if the usage stays the same.

Other factors can also impact niacin response. Taking niacin after a hot shower, during a menstrual cycle shift (if applicable), or on a day when the body is already under some sort of inflammatory load can all amplify its effects.

If the customer feels uneasy about the inconsistent response she is having, reassure her that the manufacturer uses highly controlled processes to ensure each capsule contains the intended amount. If she is still unhappy, we do have the refund policy.

### If Calcium And Magnesium Compete For Absorption Why Is Calcium Present In The Electrolyte Powder

The issue arises when the ratio of calcium to magnesium is closer to 1:1.

### Is It Possible That High Doses Of Vitamin D3 Deplete Magnesium

## Is it possible that high doses of vitamin D3 deplete magnesium?

**The Importance of Balancing Vitamin D and Magnesium**

While vitamin D offers numerous benefits for the immune system, bone health, and reducing inflammation, it's important to be aware that high doses can deplete magnesium levels in your body. This is because vitamin D and magnesium work together, and an imbalance can lead to health concerns.

**Why Magnesium Matters**

Magnesium plays a crucial role in preventing calcium buildup in soft tissues, kidneys, arteries, and joints. Without enough magnesium, high vitamin D intake could potentially lead to:

* Kidney stones
* Improper calcium deposits

**How to Maintain Balance**

* **Diet:** Consuming plenty of vegetables (at least 7 cups daily), especially leafy greens and certain nuts, provides a good source of magnesium.
* **Supplementation:** If your diet is lacking, consider a magnesium supplement. Vitamin B6 also supports the function of both magnesium and vitamin D.

**Important Note:** If you are prone to kidney stones, increase your vitamin D intake, as insufficient magnesium could increase your risk.

### Niacin And Cellular Health

## Niacin and Cellular Health

Niacin (Vitamin B3) plays a significant role in supporting cellular health through its involvement in several key biological processes:

***

#### **1. Role in Cellular Energy and Health**

* **NAD+ Production**: Niacin is essential for synthesizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme critical for energy production in cells. NAD+ supports mitochondrial function, which is vital for maintaining cellular energy and preventing premature cell aging.

***

#### **2. One-Carbon Metabolism**

* **DNA Methylation**: Niacin indirectly helps contribute to methylation cycles by ensuring sufficient energy (through NAD+) for pathways, including the synthesis of SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine), a critical methyl donor in one-carbon metabolism. Proper methylation impacts gene expression, DNA repair, and cellular functions.

***

#### **3. Telomere Health**

* **Cell Longevity**: NAD+ has been linked to maintaining and potentially repairing telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes. Healthier telomeres can slow aging-related cellular damage.

***

#### **4. Cancer Prevention**

* **DNA Repair and Anti-Inflammation**: Niacin and NAD+ are crucial for DNA repair enzymes (like PARPs), which help fix damaged DNA, potentially reducing cancer risk. Niacin also helps regulate inflammation, which, when excessive, is a known risk factor for cancer.

***

#### **5. Antioxidant Defense**

* **Reducing Oxidative Stress**: By supporting energy pathways and enzyme systems, niacin may help reduce oxidative stress, a factor in cellular damage and aging-related diseases.

***

Niacin is vital for mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and inflammation for overall cellular health.

### Should I Be Worried About The Citric Acid In The Electrolyte Powder

## Should I be worried about the citric acid in the Electrolyte Powder?

There is no need to be concerned about the natural citric acid in our Electrolyte Powder products.

The citric acid in the Electrolyte Powder is from the root vegetable cassava or tapioca. This source of citric acid is in a very low concentration.

Citric acid is vital to our health and is also made by our body. If you look at the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria, the first molecule that feeds the whole machine is citric acid.

2. **Synovial Membrane**: This is a thin tissue lining surrounding the joint. It produces synovial fluid.
3. **Synovial Fluid**: This fluid is produced by the synovial membrane and fills the joint space. It provides lubrication for smooth movement and supplies nutrients to the cartilage.
4. **Joint Capsule**: This is a rigid, fibrous structure that surrounds the joint and helps hold it together. It also contains the synovial membrane and synovial fluid.
5. **Ligaments**: Ligaments are strong bands of connective tissue that connect bones and provide stability to the joint.
6. **Tendons**: Tendons are tough bands of connective tissue that connect muscles to bones. They help move the bones across the joint when the muscles contract.
7. **Bursae**: These are small, fluid-filled sacs located around joints. They help reduce friction between tissues such as tendons, ligaments, and bones.
8. **Meniscus (in some joints)**: This is a wedge-shaped cartilage found in certain joints, such as the knee. It helps cushion and stabilize the joint and distribute weight evenly across the joint surface.

These components work together to allow smooth and stable joint movement while also supporting and protecting the bones and surrounding tissues.

### What Should I Do If I Have Adrenal Fatigue

## What should I do if I have adrenal fatigue?

The adrenal glands help the body adapt to stress, but stress accumulates from birth, making it crucial to manage. The adrenals have an outer glandular layer and an inner nerve tissue layer, involved in the fight-or-flight response. The pituitary gland controls the adrenals via feedback circuits. Key nutrients for adrenal fatigue remedies include:

**• Vitamin B1:** Stress depletes B1. Nutritional yeast is a great source, or try an adrenal formula.

**• Potassium:** Calms the body. Blood tests don't show true levels since most potassium is inside cells. Fresh vegetables, especially avocados, are excellent sources. An electrolyte powder can also help. Light exercise, particularly walking, is also beneficial for adrenal fatig

***

### Whats The Best Indicator That I Have Adrenal Fatigue

## What's the best indicator that I have adrenal fatigue?

The best indicator of adrenal fatigue is tolerance stress. If the adrenals are weakened, you can develop a short fuse and become easily irritated. You will also have a low intolerance for incompetence in others. This is because the adrenal is a stress gland and any added stress is overwhelming to the adrenal, which automatically affects your mood.

### Whats The Most Important Vitamin For Adrenal Glands

## What's the most important vitamin for adrenal glands?

The adrenal glands consist of an outer cortex (glandular tissue) and an inner medulla (neurological tissue). The medulla is involved in the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal glands help the body adapt to stress. They contain the highest concentration of vitamin C among all glands, which is essential for the functioning of both the cortex and medulla.

Vitamin C acts as a co-factor for catecholamines (neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline) and steroid hormones (like cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens), and serves as an antioxidant. Fatigue is a common symptom of both adrenal dysfunction and vitamin C deficiency. Increased stress raises the need for vitamin C, while refined carbohydrates can inhibit its utilization. Excellent sources of vitamin C include sauerkraut, bell peppers, leafy greens, and berries.

### Why Are The B Vitamins In The Natural B1 Only 25

## Why are the B vitamins in the Natural B1+ Only 25 %?

Allithiamine is the main ingredient and primary source of thiamin in Natural B1+. Since it does not have an established daily value, we cannot state a DV for the ingredient on the label.

Allithiamine is a unique lipid-soluble form of thiamin that is far more bioavailable than its water-soluble, often synthetic counterpart. We source the highest quality allithiamine naturally extracted from raw organic garlic.

Only a minimal amount of the complete B vitamin complex, 25% of the daily value in our product, is needed to help with the bioavailability and efficacy of allithiamine. These B vitamins work synergistically with 20 milligrams of magnesium to maximize the absorption rate of allithiamine.

It is common and normal for liquid probiotic products like our Friendly Bacteria Probiotic, which are naturally fermented, to have flavor variations from batch to batch. A slightly different flavor from batch to batch is often a sign that the product is a natural, living fermented food, not an indication of poor quality. As long as it's within its best-by date and has been stored correctly, this variation is normal.

***

### Why Does The Magnesium Powder Not Completely Dissolve

***

### Why Does The Multi Collagen Peptide Contain Hyaluronic Acid

## Why does the Multi Collagen Peptide contain Hyaluronic acid??

Hyaluronic acid (specifically sodium hyaluronate 95%) is included in Dr. Berg's Multi Collagen Peptide to provide added synergy because it naturally complements collagen's structural role.

Think of it this way: collagen provides the framework and scaffolding for your body's tissues, while hyaluronic acid's primary role is to retain water, contributing significantly to tissue hydration and lubrication.

**Here's a breakdown of its benefits in the Multi Collagen Peptide:**

Skin Health: Hyaluronic acid's key function is to bind water within the skin, helping to create a hydrated, plump, and supple complexion. This can potentially reduce the visibility of dryness-related fine lines.

Joint Health: It plays a critical role in joint health by contributing to lubrication and shock absorption, and supporting cartilage structure. This aims to promote ease of movement, mobility, and overall joint function.

Hair Health: While it doesn't directly affect hair strands, hyaluronic acid's contribution to scalp hydration offers an indirect benefit to hair health by supporting an optimal environment for hair follicles.

Essentially, the choice of these ingredients reflects an approach aimed at providing a diverse range of building blocks found in the body's connective tissues, enhanced with a key component for hydration. This offers more comprehensive support than a single-ingredient collagen product might.

## Why does Trace Minerals Enhanced contain Copper orotate?

Orotic acid is a naturally occurring compound involved in the body's production of DNA and RNA. It acts as a precursor in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, which is essential for creating the building blocks of these important molecules.

When orotic acid is combined with minerals (like magnesium orotate or copper orotate), it may enhance the absorption of those minerals. Some proponents suggest that orotate forms of minerals offer superior bioavailability compared to other forms.

Orotic acid is believed to have properties that allow it to readily cross cell membranes. This could potentially aid in the delivery of minerals to the cells where they are needed.

### Why Is Biotin Dv 200 On The Multi Collagen Peptide Label

## Why is biotin DV 200% on the Multi Collagen Peptide label?

With the Multi Collagen Peptide, the 200% Daily Value (DV) of biotin on the label means the product provides twice the FDA-recommended daily intake, which is set at 30 micrograms per day for adults.

Chromium is a trace mineral that helps support healthy blood sugar levels. It does this by assisting insulin, the hormone responsible for moving glucose from your bloodstream into your cells.

***

### Why Is Copper An Important Trace Mineral

## Why is copper an important trace mineral?

The trace mineral copper is crucial for the proper management of iron in the body. Excess iron can be problematic as the body has limited means to excrete it, potentially leading to accumulation and damage to organs. While menstruating females are less susceptible to overload due to blood loss, copper is necessary for keeping iron in its proper place. In fact, some instances of anemia, commonly linked to iron deficiency, may actually stem from impaired iron handling caused by a deficiency in copper, highlighting copper's vital regulatory role.

### Why Is Dr Bergs Chewable Vitamin C Superior To Any Other Vitamin C Products On The Market

## Why is Dr. Berg's Chewable Vitamin C superior to any other Vitamin C products on the market?

Think about most vitamin C supplements – they're essentially just ascorbic acid. Now, calling isolated ascorbic acid "Vitamin C" is debatable because, in nature, Vitamin C is always part of a complex. This natural complex contains ascorbic acid (the antioxidant part) along with bioflavonoids, Vitamin J, trace minerals, and other natural cofactors.

Our approach is to provide Vitamin C from a food base. Instead of the synthetic ascorbic acid often made chemically from cornstarch and sulfuric acid (yes, really, and often from China), we concentrate actual berries rich in natural Vitamin C. This way, you're getting Vitamin C in the form your body is designed by nature to receive it.

Why is cheap, synthetic ascorbic acid so common? It comes down to economics. It's incredibly cheap to manufacture, leading to immense profit margins – potentially 7000% or more. Producing natural, food-based Vitamin C is much more costly, which means significantly less profit, explaining its relative rarity in the market.

Magnesium acts as a cofactor for the enzymes involved in converting vitamin D into its active form, calcitriol. Without adequate magnesium, vitamin D remains inactive and cannot perform its essential body functions, such as calcium absorption and bone health.

***

### Why Is Potassium Citrate Used In The Electrolyte Powder Instead Of The Potassium Chloride In The Ele

## Why is Potassium Citrate used in the Electrolyte Powder instead of the potassium chloride in the Electrolyte Capsules?

Potassium Citrate has been our preferred potassium since we introduced the Electrolyte Powder. After customers requested an unflavored electrolyte product, we developed our Electrolyte Capsules. Potassium chloride is used in our Electrolyte Capsules due to its higher amount of elemental potassium per gram than potassium citrate. Potassium chloride allows us to fit the optimal amount of potassium within a capsule's constraints.

***

### Why Is Selenium An Important Trace Mineral

## Why is selenium an important trace mineral?

Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is often deficient in soil in certain regions, such as the East Coast. This soil deficiency affects animal health, leading to reproductive problems, smaller size, reduced lifespan, and muscle weakness in livestock like sheep, cows, and goats. In humans, selenium is crucial for thyroid function and immune health; deficiency is linked to increased susceptibility to thyroid issues and autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's. While Brazil nuts are a good dietary source, they should be consumed in moderation to avoid selenium toxicity. However, many people do not regularly consume selenium-rich foods, contributing to widespread deficiency. Adequate selenium intake is vital for a healthy immune system.

### Why Is The Epa And Dha Amounts In Cod Liver Capsules Less Than Other Products In The Market

## Why is the EPA and DHA amounts in Cod Liver Capsules less than other products in the market?

The processing of our cod liver oil is made into a powder that is less potent in DHA and EPA but has other digestive benefits to assist with the absorption of the cod liver oil. The powder also extends the shelf life considerably.

Cod liver is not generally high in DHA and EPA, in comparison to other fish oils like sardine oil. Most cod liver capsules are added to a secondary fish oil which may be a higher source of DHA and EPA.

### Why Is There A Prop 65 Warning On The Nutritional Yeast

## Why is There a Prop 65 Warning on the Nutritional Yeast?

Here's a rewrite focusing on transparency and customer reassurance:

**Important Information About a Recent Test Result**

We recently discovered that one batch of our Nutritional Yeast exceeded the California Proposition 65 (Prop 65) lead limit. As a result, we've added a Prop 65 warning label to this specific batch.

We understand this label can be concerning. Here's why it's important to know:

* **Safety First:** We take product safety very seriously and conduct thorough third-party testing.
* **Prop 65 and Lead Limits:** Prop 65 has extremely low thresholds for lead that are intended for potential long-term exposure in industrial settings. The actual lead level in this batch is very low and well within safe limits for consumption.
* **Dr. Berg Explains Prop 65:** For a more detailed explanation of Prop 65 and lead levels, you can watch this video by Dr. Berg: Insert YouTube video.

### Why Is There A Warning On The Canadian Version Of The Electrolyte Powder

## Why is there a warning on the Canadian version of the Electrolyte Powder?

The statement “Not to be used following vigorous exercise” is required on the Canadian Electrolyte Powder label (NPN 80106216) because of the high potassium content (1,000 mg per serving).

According to Health Canada’s product licensing standards, when a supplement provides potassium at or above certain thresholds (typically ≥975 mg per day), this specific caution is required. The reason is that potassium levels in the body can shift significantly after vigorous exercise or dehydration, and individuals may be more susceptible to electrolyte imbalances under these conditions, especially if they have kidney issues or are taking medications that affect potassium levels.

The warning is part of Health Canada’s broader safety guidance for high-potency electrolyte products, aimed at helping reduce the risk of complications such as low blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, or muscle weakness when potassium is consumed inappropriately during recovery.

### Why Is There Microcrystalline Cellulose In The D3 K2 Vitamins

## Why is there microcrystalline cellulose in the D3 & K2 Vitamins?

We're excited to share that we are actively transitioning to formulas without microcrystalline cellulose! We are replacing microcrystalline cellulose with the amino acid L-leucine in our products.

Only two products, Vitamin D3 & K2 and Trace Minerals Enhanced, will continue to contain a small amount of microcrystalline cellulose. This is due to challenges encountered during production where the ingredients adhered to the machinery without it. Rest assured, we are actively researching and developing solutions to eliminate it from these products as well.

Our new and improved formula, featuring L-leucine instead of microcrystalline cellulose, is already in our Natural Vitamin B1+! This positive change will extend across our entire product line as existing inventory is replenished so you can enjoy the enhanced formula in all your favorite Dr. Berg products very soon.

### Why Is Zinc An Important Trace Mineral

## Why is zinc an important trace mineral?

Zinc is an essential mineral vital for numerous bodily functions. It is particularly crucial for the senses of smell and taste; a deficiency can impair these senses, potentially affecting appetite and food choices. Zinc is also necessary for the body to utilize Vitamin A, and a deficiency in either can impact vision, especially night vision. Globally, zinc deficiency is a significant health issue, tragically contributing to child mortality from conditions like diarrhea in certain regions. A contributing factor to deficiency, even when zinc is consumed, is the presence of phytic acid in foods like cereals, which can block zinc absorption. Furthermore, zinc is important for maintaining gut health and the integrity of the intestinal barrier.

### Why Was Calcium Added To The Vitamin D3 K2 With Zinc Mct Oil When Dr Berg Says Does Not Recommend Ca

## Why was calcium added to the Vitamin D3 & K2 with Zinc & MCT Oil when Dr. Berg says does not recommend calcium supplementation?

The calcium found in the Vitamin D3 & K2 with Zinc & MCT Oil is naturally derived from the ingredients in the product, primarily the MCT Oil. No amount of calcium has been added to the formulation.

While Dr. Berg does not recommend specific calcium supplementation, calcium is crucial for overall health and wellness. Typically calcium supplementation is not required as adequate amounts can be obtained through a healthy diet, especially vegetables which pull calcium from the soil. Dairy can also be a good source of calcium.

However, one form of calcium supplementation should be avoided; calcium carbonate supplementation. Dr. Berg has created videos about the adverse effects of calcium carbonate - [https://youtu.be/VCpbvwM-5U4](https://youtu.be/VCpbvwM-5U4) and [https://youtu.be/hLP3SnbQvEc](https://youtu.be/hLP3SnbQvEc).

There is no calcium carbonate in the Vitamin D3 & K2 with Zinc & MCT Oil.

Additionally, all calcium, whether supplemented or acquired from your diet, needs vitamin K2 to help move the calcium out of the bloodstream, where it can create coronary calcification and subsequently heart disease, and into the bones. Vitamin D3 & K2 with Zinc & MCT Oil contains 50.3 mcg, 40% of the Recommended Daily Value.

### Will The Lack Of Copper With The Zinc In D3 K2 Vitamin Create A Copper Deficiency

## Will the lack of copper with the zinc in D3 & K2 Vitamin create a copper deficiency?

The vitamins and minerals in the D3 & K2 Vitamin product are specifically chosen cofactors required to increase the absorption of vitamin D and allow its activation in both bone health and immunity building. Zinc is one of these required cofactors while copper is not.

Zinc and copper do have a recommended ideal ratio of 8:1, with acceptable ranges of 4:1 to 12:1. Zinc deficiency is far more prevalent than copper deficiency as copper can be obtained through many dietary sources. On the other hand, many foods deplete zinc stores due to their phytates, including legumes, seeds, soy products, and whole grains, and their oxalates, including such foods as spinach, okra, nuts, and tea. The D3 & K2 Vitamin is specifically formulated to address zinc deficiency.

Additionally, Vitamin D supplementation can help with copper retention in the body, further reducing the possibility of copper deficiency. However, zinc in high quantities, 60mg or more a day, over a long period of time can cause some copper deficiencies.

Here are some signs of a copper deficiency:

1\. Nausea

2\. Flu-like symptoms (this is due to neutropenia, which is lowered white blood cells)

3\. Anemia (fatigue and weakness)

4\. Stomach pain

5\. Tingling and numbness in the hands or feet

6\. Diarrhea

7\. Loss of skin tone

8\. Vomiting
