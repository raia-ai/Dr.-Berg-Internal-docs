### Canceled Order Due To Fraud Risk

## Canceled Order Due To Fraud Risk

**Purpose:** To guide agents on how to proceed when a customer's order has been cancelled due to a "High" or "Medium Risk Fraud" flag, but the customer has reached out in good faith to verify the order.

If a customer contacts us after their order was canceled due to fraud, it is safe to assume—per guidance from Alla—that they are the legitimate owner of the transaction. In such cases, the fraud tag may be removed to allow the customer to place a new order.

#### **Steps to Remove the “High/Medium Risk Fraud” Tag:**

1. Go to the **customer’s profile** in the system.
2. Locate the tag labeled **"High Risk Fraud"** or **"Medium Risk Fraud"**.
3. Click the **“X”** next to the tag to remove it.
4. Click **“Save”** to apply the changes.

#### **Reminders:**

* Only remove the tag **if the customer reaches out proactively** to resolve the issue.
* There is no need for additional approval, as this process follows verified guidance.
* For documentation and future reference, consider noting the action in the customer’s interaction history.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions**

**1. Am I eligible for a refund?** Refunds are only available for your **first purchase** of a specific product. If you’ve already received a refund for the same item before, future purchases are considered final and **not eligible** for a refund.

If it’s your **first time** trying the product, you **may be eligible** for a refund. We no longer accept returns or ask customers to refuse delivery. Refunds are issued based on order history and eligibility.

***

**3. I ordered multiple units—can I return the extras?** Purchasing **three or more units** suggests a higher commitment to the product. Refunds in this case are rarely granted. If eligible, the customer may be asked to return any **unopened** units at their own expense. Provide the VA office return address if necessary.

### Processing Refunds For Magento Orders

## Processing refunds for Magento orders

This is very important. When you process a refund for a Magento order in Shopify, you need to email Roxanna M. so she can manually refund the order.

Processing the refund in Shopify for a Magento order is currently creating a "Manual Entry" and is not issuing the refund.
