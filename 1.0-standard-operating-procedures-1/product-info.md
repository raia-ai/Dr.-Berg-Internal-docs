### Australian Customer Locate A Multi Collagen Product

## Australian Customer Locate a Multi Collagen Product

While we don’t have a specific brand recommendation, if our Multi Collagen Peptides are unavailable in Australia, here are some best practices to help you choose a high-quality collagen supplement with similar benefits:

Match the collagen types – Look for a blend that includes Types I, II, III, V, and X, ideally from grass-fed bovine and wild-caught sources.

Added nutrients – Collagen works best when paired with vitamin C and biotin to support absorption and benefits for skin, hair, and joints.

Clean and certified – Choose products that are third-party tested, non-GMO, glyphosate-free, and free from artificial fillers.

Locally sourced – Australian-made products ensure freshness and often follow strict quality standards, while adhering to local requirements.

Mixability and taste – Unflavored or lightly flavored collagen powders that dissolve easily make daily use more convenient.

***

### Can I Take The Probiotic With Prebiotic Blend With The Advanced Digestive Enzymes

## Can I take the Probiotic with Prebiotic Blend with the Advanced Digestive Enzymes?

Yes, you can take the Probiotic with the Prebiotic Blend along with digestive enzymes. Combining a digestive enzyme supplement with probiotics can significantly enhance their health benefits. Digestive enzymes help break down food into smaller particles, releasing prebiotic fibers that probiotic microbes can ferment to generate energy and nutrients. This synergy supports overall digestive health and nutrient absorption.

While the two supplements can be taken together, it is best to take them at different times of the day. Advanced Digestive Enzymes are best taken a few minutes before a meal to help raise the acidity in the stomach. However, Probiotic with Prebiotic Blend is best in the morning, during a meal, or after meals when stomach acidity is lower. This timing helps ensure that the probiotics survive the acidic conditions of the stomach and reach the intestines, where they can be most effective.

The Gallbladder Formula focuses on supporting gallbladder health and aiding digestion. At the same time, the Nerve Support with Benfotiamine aims to support nerve health. There is no indication that these two supplements interact negatively with each other. However, it's always a good practice to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.

***

L-Methylfolate is not an ingredient in any of our products. However, some of our products, such as Nerve Support with Benfotiamine and Natural Prenatal Vitamins, do contain 5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium.

5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium (or L-5-MTHF Ca) is the calcium salt of L-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, also known as Levomefolic acid or 5-MTHF. It is a biologically active form of folate, a B vitamin that is essential for various bodily functions.

Key points about 5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium:

* **Biologically Active:** Unlike folic acid, which needs to be converted in the body, 5-MTHF is already in a usable form, making it easily absorbed and utilized.
* **Essential for Health:** It plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis, cell division, and amino acid metabolism. It is also vital for fetal development during pregnancy.

Magnesium glycinate is not alkaline enough to significantly neutralize or alter gastric pH.

***

### Does Sea Kelp Enhanced Iodine Contain Magnesium Stearate

## Does Sea Kelp Enhanced Iodine contain magnesium stearate?

**Sea Kelp Enhanced Iodine - Magnesium Stearate**

Magnesium stearate is a common additive used in supplements, primarily as a lubricant and flow agent.

* **Lubricant:** Magnesium stearate reduces friction between ingredients and manufacturing equipment during production. This prevents the ingredients from sticking to the machinery, ensuring smooth production and consistent capsule filling.
* **Flow Agent:** It improves the flow properties of powders, allowing them to move smoothly through the machinery and fill capsules uniformly. This ensures accurate dosage and consistent product quality.
* **Safe in Small Amounts:** Magnesium stearate is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA when used in small amounts. The amount typically used in supplements is minimal and is not considered harmful.

***

### Does Stevia Leaf Extract Have Any Effect On The Taste Of The Supplement

## Does stevia leaf extract have any effect on the taste of the supplement?

**Stevia Leaf Extract**

In Dr. Berg's Chewable Vitamin C Complex, Stevia leaf extract provides these primary benefits:

* **Natural Sweetener:** Stevia offers a natural, zero-calorie sweetness to enhance the taste of the chewable wafers without contributing to blood sugar levels. This makes it a suitable option for those following a ketogenic diet or watching their sugar intake.
* **No Artificial Sweeteners:** The use of stevia leaf extract aligns with Dr. Berg's emphasis on natural ingredients, avoiding artificial sweeteners.

## Does the Betaine HCL in the Advanced Digestive Enzymes supplement render the enzymes to become inactive and if not, what in the formula ensures the enzymes will not become inactive?

**Supplements**

### Dr Berg Brand Recommendations Help Choosing A Brand

## Dr. Berg Brand Recommendations - Help Choosing a Brand

As a Dr. Berg Advisor, I am trained in our products, services, and resources. However, I cannot advise on other companies' products or services. Please know that Dr. Berg attempted to create a "Dr. Berg Approved" program to give his 'stamp of approval' to certain companies and their products. Once he began to work with potential partners on this program, Dr. Berg realized that he could not approve of a product or company whose sourcing, purity, manufacturing, and marketing practices he could not verify. Instead, he has focused on creating the best products and business practices at Dr. Berg Nutritionals.

_**However,**_ best practices for finding a quality supplement - 3rd party testing and requesting results to verify the product's contents, the microbial testing and heavy metals report, GMP-certified manufacturing, organic, if possible, non-GMO.

### Email Response For People With Nut Peanut Allergies Manufacturing Facility

## Email Response for People with Nut & Peanut Allergies & Manufacturing Facility

Thank you for reaching out to us about potential peanut cross-contamination. We understand your concern and appreciate your taking the time to contact us. Our products and supplements themselves do not contain peanuts or tree nuts. However, there are peanut products in a different location within our manufacturing facility.

To ensure the safety of our customers with peanut allergies, we adhere to strict manufacturing processes:

* **Separate Facilities:** While peanut products are manufactured in our facility, they are produced in a completely separate area from our other products.
* **Thorough Cleaning:** We have rigorous cleaning procedures in place between production runs to minimize any risk of cross-contamination. This includes specialized cleaning of equipment and common areas.
* **Dedicated Equipment:** Whenever possible, we use dedicated equipment for specific product lines to further reduce the potential for cross-contact.
* **Quality Control:** We have a robust quality control system that includes testing for allergens to ensure our products meet the highest safety standards.

While we take every precaution to prevent cross-contamination, we cannot guarantee that our products are 100% free of trace amounts of peanuts. This is a common challenge for manufacturers who produce multiple products in the same facility.

### Is Magnesium Important For The Body

## Is magnesium important for the body?

Magnesium is crucial for the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of our cells.

Without sufficient magnesium, our bodies struggle to generate the energy needed for various bodily functions.

Here's why magnesium is so important for ATP production:

* **ATP Structure:** Magnesium ions bind to ATP molecules, stabilizing their structure and making them biologically active. Without magnesium, ATP is essentially useless for providing energy.
* **Enzyme Activation:** Magnesium acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in ATP production, particularly in the process of oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria (the powerhouses of the cell).
* **Cellular Respiration:** Magnesium participates in various steps of cellular respiration, the process by which cells break down glucose to produce ATP.

In essence, magnesium acts as a vital catalyst, enabling the chemical reactions necessary to create and utilize ATP for energy.

***

### Is Silicon Dioxide Safe

## Is Silicon Dioxide safe?

Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in food supplements. However, long-term inhalation of silicon dioxide dust into the respiratory system may negatively impact health.

Silicon dioxide is used in supplements to prevent powdered ingredients from sticking together.

Silicon dioxide comprises two of Earth's most abundant materials: silicon and oxygen. Silicon should not be confused with silicone. Silicone is a man-made liquid or a flexible, rubberlike plastic material that is unsafe for consumption. Silicon dioxide is found naturally in the tissues of the human body and in many plants, such as:

* leafy green vegetables
* beets
* bell peppers
* alfalfa

The Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM) allocated a safe upper level of 25 mg/kg body weight per day (equivalent to 1,500 mg/day for a 60‐kg/132-pound adult).

## Is Silicon Dioxide the same as sand?

While it might sound similar, silicon dioxide is not the same as the sand on the beach. Also known as silica, this naturally occurring compound has the chemical formula SiO2. You'll find it in surprising places – like leafy greens, beets, brown rice, alfalfa, and even in the mineral quartz. In food products, it's used in a dry, fluffy form to prevent ingredients from clumping and spoiling due to moisture.

***

### Is Sodium An Important Ingredient In Electrolyte Powder

## Is sodium an important ingredient in Electrolyte Powder?

Sodium plays a crucial role in electrolyte powders for several reasons:

1. **Fluid Balance**:
   * Sodium helps manage water distribution in your body, ensuring that cells don't either shrink or bloat with too much water. This balance is essential for maintaining proper hydration levels.
2. **Electrical Currents**:
   * Sodium is vital for creating electrical currents that facilitate various physiological functions, including nerve signal transmission and muscle function.
3. **Blood Pressure Regulation**:
   * Sodium helps regulate blood pressure. An imbalance in sodium levels can lead to either high or low blood pressure, both of which can have significant health implications.
4. **Nutrient Exchange**:
   * The sodium-potassium pump, a critical cellular mechanism, actively transports potassium into and shuffles sodium out of cells. This process is essential for nutrient exchange and waste removal at the cellular level.
5. **Energy Production**:
   * Sodium is necessary for maintaining an electrical charge within cells, which is crucial for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body's main energy currency.

These functions underscore the importance of sodium in electrolyte powders, making it a key component for maintaining overall health and physiological balance.

### Is The Powdered Form Of Vitamin D3 Less Effective Than The Liquid Form Of D3

## Is the powdered form of Vitamin D3 less effective than the liquid form of D3?

Both our dry and liquid D3 supplements are highly effective. D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it needs some fat for optimal absorption. Here's how we ensure you get the most out of our products:

* **Dry Formula:** Our capsules include MCT powder for fat-soluble support, plus ox bile for further absorption enhancement.
* **Liquid Formula:** We use MCT and fractionated coconut oil as carriers, avoiding inflammatory vegetable oils commonly found in other brands.

Both forms use the same true form of D3 (cholecalciferol).

## Is the vitamin D3 in your products vegan and vegetarian-friendly?

The Vitamin D3 in most of our products is derived from lanolin (sheep's wool extract), making it unsuitable for vegans. However, it might be considered vegetarian by some individuals, as the lanolin is sourced from sheared wool without harming the animals, rather than from animal flesh. Please note this information does not apply to our 'Vitamin D3 & K2 with Oxbile' product.

***

### Is The Whole Food Multivitamin Supplement Water Or Fat Soluble

## Is the Whole Food Multivitamin supplement water or fat soluble?

### Medical Disclaimer Supplements Drug Interactions

## Medical Disclaimer - Supplements - Drug Interactions

Dr. Berg Nutritionals produces dietary supplements and is not a medical office. According to United States regulations, we cannot provide information about supplemental nutrients and their interactions with medical drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements are regulated as food under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). Supplement manufacturers are responsible for ensuring their products are safe and accurately labeled but are not required to test for safety with medications before marketing. Before starting a new supplement, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider or pharmacist, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or are taking medication.

If your doctor or pharmacist does not have interaction information, the medication manufacturer is also a resource. Drug manufacturers must look for interactions if the drug's mechanism of action has a known or suspected interaction with nutrients and dietary supplements.

### N Acetylcarnosine Nac Eye Drops

## N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) Eye Drops

While Dr. Berg Nutritionals does not sell N-acetylcarnosine (NAC), we are happy to provide educational information about the amino acid. When purchasing NAC, consider reputable sellers with positive customer feedback. Always thoroughly research potential suppliers for any supplements.

**NAC and Eye Health**

* **L-carnosine:** This potent antioxidant supports mitochondrial function, counteracts glycation (a damaging sugar-protein reaction), and helps regulate pH levels. While excellent for overall health, L-carnosine alone cannot easily reach eye tissues.
* **N-acetylcarnosine (NAC):** This form enables carnosine to penetrate the eye. Research suggests a 1% NAC solution, used 1-2 drops, 2-3 times daily, may benefit conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration.

### Update On The Usage Of Microcrystalline In Dr Bergs Products

## Update on the usage of microcrystalline in Dr. Berg's products

We're excited to share that we are actively transitioning to formulas without microcrystalline cellulose! We are replacing microcrystalline cellulose with the amino acid L-leucine in our products.

Only two products, Vitamin D3 & K2 and Trace Minerals Enhanced, will continue to contain a small amount of microcrystalline cellulose. This is due to challenges encountered during production where the ingredients adhered to the machinery without it. Rest assured, we are actively researching and developing solutions to eliminate it from these products as well.

Our new and improved formula, featuring L-leucine instead of microcrystalline cellulose, is already in our Natural Vitamin B1+! This positive change will extend across our entire product line as existing inventory is replenished so you can enjoy the enhanced formula in all your favorite Dr. Berg products very soon.

### What Is A Potential Danger With Vitamin D

## What is a potential danger with Vitamin D?

**Vitamin D: Unraveling the Misconceptions**

There's a lot of confusion surrounding vitamin D. It's crucial to remember that blood levels of vitamin D don't necessarily reflect the amount inside your cells. Additionally, relying solely on food for sufficient vitamin D is unrealistic.

**Two Distinct Vitamin D Systems**

Vitamin D plays a complex role in your body. While one system regulates calcium and bone health, another governs non-calcium functions, including immune response, prostate health, skin, gut, brain, and muscle health. Surprisingly, only a tiny fraction of vitamin D from your blood enters this second system.

**Research Focus: Calcium and Bone Health**

Most vitamin D research centers on calcium and bone health, often recommending only 600-800 IU per day. This amount might suffice for bone health but may fall short in supporting other critical bodily functions.

**Barriers to Vitamin D Absorption**

Several factors can impede vitamin D absorption, including:

* Air pollution
* Sunscreen use and sun avoidance
* Gut inflammation
* Magnesium deficiency
* Genetic predispositions
* Latitude, altitude, and seasonality
* Aging
* Insulin resistance
* Low cholesterol levels
* Absence of gallbladder

**Optimal Vitamin D Intake**

For a healthy individual, aiming for around 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day is generally recommended. If you have existing health conditions, you might need even higher amounts. Consulting with a healthcare professional is essential to determine your ideal vitamin D intake.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Blood levels of vitamin D aren't the only indicator of your true vitamin D status.
* Obtaining enough vitamin D through diet alone is challenging.
* Vitamin D's role extends beyond calcium and bone health.
* Numerous factors can hinder vitamin D absorption.
* A healthy person likely needs around 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day.

Remember, vitamin D is vital for overall health and well-being. Stay informed and work with a healthcare provider to optimize your vitamin D levels.

Stevia can be used as a sweetener in several forms, all derived from the stevia leaf itself.

Stevia leaf is a natural, whole leaf that undergoes minimal processing to create the final sweetener. It is less sweet than stevia extract and can have a bitter, herbal taste.

Stevia extract is a concentrated, processed form of stevia sweetener. It undergoes purification and concentration, resulting in a much sweeter and more consistent taste. Stevia extracts are 20-40 times sweeter than whole-leaf stevia.

98% Rebaudioside-A is a high-purity extract of the compound Rebaudioside A, one of the main sweetening components found in stevia leaves. The '98%' indicates the purity level of Rebaudioside A in the extract, assuring its high concentration and purity.

***

### Why Do We Use The Synthetic Form Of Vitamin K2 Mk 7 In Our Vitamin D3 K2 Products

## Why do we use the synthetic form of Vitamin K2 (MK-7) in our Vitamin D3 & K2 products?

While Dr. Berg recommends obtaining MK-7 vitamin K2 from natural food sources like natto and aged cheeses, sourcing it for supplement manufacturing can be challenging. Synthetic MK-7 vitamin K2 is commonly used in supplements because it is more accessible, scalable, stable, and consistent in potency than natural sources. It allows for precise usage and has a longer shelf life. Additionally, synthetic MK-7 is often allergen-free, vegan-friendly, and sometimes formulated for better absorption. All these factors make the synthetic form of MK-7 a more reliable option for supplements.

Studies have shown that synthetic MK-7 is bioequivalent to natural MK-7, indicating that the body processes it similarly. Dr. Berg Nutritionals uses the trans form of MK-7 vitamin K2, which is superior due to its higher bioavailability, longer active blood circulation time, and more effective activation of key proteins associated with bone and artery health than cis forms. It provides benefits at lower doses and is the biologically active form that the body can readily utilize.

### Why Does Dr Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients Benfotamine

## Why Does Dr. Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients - Benfotamine

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Benfotiamine (Synthetic Vitamin B1)**

Superior Absorption: Benfotiamine is specifically designed for your body to utilize it, unlike standard thiamine, which passes through the body quickly. This synthetic form is fat-soluble, so it crosses cell membranes and reaches nerve tissues where it’s needed most.

Targeted Benefits: You’d have to take large doses of standard thiamine to match the effectiveness of benfotiamine. This form was created specifically to help support nerve health in a way that natural thiamine simply can’t.

 Exclusively Synthetic: Benfotiamine isn’t found in nature—it must be created in a lab. This synthetic form ensures a consistently pure, potent, and bioavailable dose that nature does not provide.

Bottom Line: Benfotiamine isn’t used to avoid natural ingredients—it’s used because it is not found in nature and works better, faster, and more reliably than standard natural thiamine.

### Why Does Dr Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients Such As Alpha Lipoid Acid

## Why does Dr. Berg use synthetic ingredients such as Alpha Lipoid Acid?

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)**

Clinically Supported Blend: The synthetic form (s-ALA) contains both R-ALA (the naturally occurring, active form) and S-ALA. This racemic mixture is the same form used in most clinical studies, which have shown benefits for blood sugar balance, antioxidant support, and nerve health.

Stable and Reliable: While R-ALA is more bioactive, it’s also unstable in isolation, which can reduce its effectiveness unless it’s carefully stabilized. The s-ALA blend ensures long-term stability, purity, and shelf life.

Effective: s-ALA delivers a consistent, research-backed dose of active ALA in a form your body can use, without the limitations of isolated R-ALA.

Bottom Line: While pure R-ALA may offer enhanced potency, the synthetic blend offers proven, practical support in a stable format used in most ALA research.

**Choline Bitartrate**

High Concentration: Natural choline from food is valuable—but often not concentrated enough to meet specific needs like liver health or methylation support. Choline bitartrate provides a focused, supplemental dose.

Standardized and Stable: This form delivers choline in a clean, consistent, and predictable way—every time. No variability, just reliable results.

Effective Nutritional Support: Its stability and potency make it ideal for targeted strategies where dietary intake alone may fall short.

Bottom Line: This carefully crafted form of choline offers dependable, concentrated support that complements your nutrition and delivers on specific health goals.

**TUDCA (Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid)**

Cruelty-Free & Ethical: TUDCA was once extracted from bear bile. Today, it’s synthesized to protect wildlife and ensure ethical sourcing—no animals harmed.

Safe and Clean: Synthetic TUDCA is made in a lab to be free from pathogens and contaminants. It’s standardized and dosed exactly like the forms used in scientific studies.

Reliable Supply: Unlike animal-based sources, synthetic TUDCA is sustainable and scalable—so you get the same quality every time.

### Why Is Microcrystalline Cellulose In The Products

## Why is microcrystalline cellulose in the products?

We're excited to share that we are actively transitioning to formulas without microcrystalline cellulose! We are replacing microcrystalline cellulose with the amino acid L-leucine in our products.

Only two products, Vitamin D3 & K2 and Trace Minerals Enhanced, will continue to contain a small amount of microcrystalline cellulose. This is due to challenges encountered during production where the ingredients adhered to the machinery without it. Rest assured, we are actively researching and developing solutions to eliminate it from these products as well.

Our new and improved formula, featuring L-leucine instead of microcrystalline cellulose, is already in our Natural Vitamin B1+! This positive change will extend across our entire product line as existing inventory is replenished so you can enjoy the enhanced formula in all your favorite Dr. Berg products very soon.

### Why Was Magnesium Citrate Used In Vitamin D3K2 Instead Of Magnesium Glycinate

## Why was magnesium citrate used in Vitamin D3K2 instead of magnesium glycinate?

We opted for magnesium citrate in our D3 & K2 vitamin formula due to capsule size limitations. Achieving the desired 25mg of magnesium requires less volume with magnesium citrate than with magnesium glycinate. Using magnesium glycinate would have made it impossible to fit all the necessary ingredients into a single capsule.
