### How Should I Address An Inquiry About The Lawsuit On The Subject Of An Electrolyte Powder

## How should I address an inquiry about the lawsuit on the subject of an Electrolyte Powder?

**The settlement for this case is subject to confidentiality so we need to be very careful in not giving specifics about the resolution.**

**“HWC consistently denied that its labels violated any law, or that HWC had any liability to Mr. Scheibe. We agreed to resolve this case to avoid the increasing expense and burden of litigation. The parties settled the case in 2023 on confidential terms, and the lawsuit was thereafter dismissed with prejudice as to Mr. Scheibe’s claims.”**

**Any calls about this should get routed to the manager and handled per Roxana Chumpitaz's instructions!**
