# How to Cancel or Change an Order

## Overview

This SOP explains when and how orders can be cancelled or modified, and what to do when it's too late.

## Important Policy

**We cannot cancel or change orders once they reach our warehouse.**

This means:
- Orders placed during business hours may reach the warehouse within 1-2 hours
- Orders placed on weekends will be processed Monday morning
- Once in warehouse system, orders cannot be stopped

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Check Order Status

Ask the customer for their **order number** and check the system:

1. **Order Status: "Open" or "Pending"**
   - Order has NOT reached warehouse yet
   - Cancellation MAY be possible
   - Proceed to Step 2

2. **Order Status: "Processing" or "Shipped"**
   - Order has reached warehouse or already shipped
   - Cancellation is NOT possible
   - Proceed to Step 3 (Refund Option)

### Step 2: If Order is Still "Open" or "Pending"

1. Contact warehouse team immediately:
   - Email: orders@drberg.com
   - Subject: "URGENT: Order Cancellation Request - Order #[number]"
   - Include: Customer name, order number, reason for cancellation

2. Inform customer:
   > "I've submitted an urgent cancellation request to our warehouse team. However, I cannot guarantee we'll be able to stop the order before it ships. If we're unable to cancel it, you can request a refund once you receive the package, and you won't need to return it."

3. Follow up with customer within 24 hours with confirmation

### Step 3: If Order Cannot be Cancelled

Inform the customer:
> "I apologize, but your order has already reached our warehouse and cannot be cancelled or modified at this stage. However, once you receive the package, you can request a full refund within 30 days, and you won't need to return the product. Would you like me to help you with anything else?"

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer wants to change shipping address

**If order is still "Open":**
1. Contact warehouse: orders@drberg.com
2. Include: Order number, old address, new address
3. Inform customer it may not be possible if already processed

**If order is "Processing" or "Shipped":**
- Cannot change address
- Customer must contact shipping carrier (UPS/USPS) directly with tracking number
- Provide tracking number to customer

### Scenario 2: Customer wants to add items to order

**Always:**
- Cannot add items to existing orders
- Customer must place a separate order
- Offer to help them place new order

### Scenario 3: Customer wants to change product/size/flavor

**Always:**
- Cannot modify product details once ordered
- Options:
  1. Try to cancel order (if still "Open")
  2. If shipped, customer can request refund and place new order

## Important Notes

- **Weekend orders**: Processed Monday morning, so cancellation requests submitted on weekends have higher success rate
- **Business day orders**: Very short window (1-2 hours) to catch orders before warehouse processing
- **No partial cancellations**: Cannot cancel individual items from multi-product orders

## Customer Communication Templates

### Template 1: Order Already Shipped
> "I've checked your order #[number], and it has already shipped. Your tracking number is [tracking]. While we can't cancel it now, you can request a full refund within 30 days of receiving it, and you won't need to return the product. Our return policy is here: https://shop.drberg.com/return-policy"

### Template 2: Will Try to Cancel
> "I've submitted an urgent cancellation request for order #[number]. Our warehouse team will do their best to stop it, but I cannot guarantee success as orders process quickly. I'll follow up with you within 24 hours to confirm whether we were able to cancel it."

### Template 3: Cannot Change Address
> "Unfortunately, your order has already shipped and we cannot change the delivery address. However, you can contact the shipping carrier directly with your tracking number [tracking] to request an address change or hold for pickup. Would you like me to provide the carrier's contact information?"

## Escalation

Escalate to **Supervisor/Manager** if:
- Customer is extremely upset about inability to cancel
- Order contains high-value items ($200+)
- Customer claims they didn't authorize the order
- Suspected fraudulent order
