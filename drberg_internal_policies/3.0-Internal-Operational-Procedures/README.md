# Internal Operational Procedures

## Overview

This section contains **true internal operational SOPs** for the customer support team. These are step-by-step workflows, escalation procedures, response templates, and quality standards that help you perform your job effectively.

## What's in This Section

This section includes procedures for:

- **Processing refunds** - Step-by-step workflow for handling refund requests

- **Escalation matrix** - Who to contact for what type of issue
- **Response templates** - Pre-written templates for common scenarios
- **Quality checklist** - Standards to meet before sending any response

## How This Differs from Section 1.0

**Section 1.0 (Standard Operating Procedures):**

- Answers customer questions about products, health topics, policies
- Used to help customers understand Dr. Berg's content and products

**Section 3.0 (Internal Operational Procedures):**
- Contains internal workflows for employees
- Step-by-step instructions for processing orders, refunds, escalations
- Used to help YOU do your job more effectively

## When to Use This Section
