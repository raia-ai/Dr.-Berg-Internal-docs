# Quality Checklist: Before Sending Responses

## Overview

Use this checklist before sending ANY customer response (email, chat, SMS, phone follow-up) to ensure quality, accuracy, and professionalism.

---

## The 10-Point Quality Checklist

### ✅ 1. Did I address the customer's actual question?

**Check:**
- Re-read the customer's message
- Confirm you answered what they asked (not what you assumed they asked)
- If they asked multiple questions, did you answer ALL of them?

**Common Mistake:**
- Customer asks: "When will my order ship?"
- Bad response: "Our shipping policy is here: [link]"
- Good response: "Your order #12345 will ship today and arrive in 1-2 business days. Tracking: [link]"

---

### ✅ 2. Is my information accurate?

**Verify:**
- Order numbers, tracking numbers, dates
- Product names, prices, links
- Policy details (30-day return, shipping times, etc.)
- Dr. Berg's content (don't make up what he says)

**If unsure:**
- Check the knowledge base
- Ask a supervisor
- Don't guess or make assumptions

---

### ✅ 3. Did I use the customer's name?

**Personalization matters:**
- ✅ "Hi Sarah," or "Hi Sarah Jones,"
- ❌ "Hi," or "Hello,"

**Exception:**
- If customer didn't provide name, use "Hi there," or "Hello,"

---

### ✅ 4. Is my tone appropriate?

**Match the situation:**
- **Happy customer** → Friendly, enthusiastic
- **Neutral inquiry** → Professional, helpful
- **Frustrated customer** → Empathetic, apologetic, solution-focused
- **Angry customer** → Calm, understanding, de-escalating

**Empathy phrases:**
- "I understand how frustrating this must be..."
- "I'm so sorry you're experiencing this..."
- "I appreciate your patience..."
- "I can see why you'd be concerned..."

---

### ✅ 5. Did I provide a solution or next step?

**Every response should include:**
- What you're doing to help
- What the customer should expect next
- Timeline for resolution (if applicable)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "I've processed your refund. You'll receive $50 within 5-7 business days."
- ✅ "I'm escalating this to our QA team. They'll reach out within 24 hours."
- ❌ "I understand your concern." [No solution provided]

---

### ✅ 6. Did I include relevant links or resources?

**Helpful links:**
- Product pages
- Tracking links
- Policy pages (return, shipping)
- Dr. Berg's YouTube videos (if relevant)
- Support portal

**Make links clickable:**
- ✅ "Track your order here: https://tracking.ups.com/12345"
- ❌ "You can track your order at the UPS website"

---

### ✅ 7. Did I avoid making promises I can't keep?

**Be careful with:**
- "I guarantee..."
- "This will definitely..."
- "You'll receive it by..."
- "This product will cure..."

**Use instead:**
- "Typically..."
- "Most customers experience..."
- "Estimated delivery is..."
- "This product supports..."

**Never promise:**
- Specific health outcomes
- Exact delivery dates (beyond carrier estimates)
- Refunds/exceptions you're not authorized to approve

---

### ✅ 8. Did I include medical disclaimer (if needed)?

**Add disclaimer if:**
- Discussing health conditions
- Recommending supplements for specific issues
- Customer mentions medications
- Customer describes symptoms

**Disclaimer template:**
> "Please note: This information is educational and not medical advice. For personalized recommendations, especially if you have medical conditions or take medications, please consult your healthcare provider."

---

### ✅ 9. Is my response clear and concise?

**Check for:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Bullet points for lists
- No jargon or confusing language
- Proper grammar and spelling

**Too long?**
- If over 600 characters for live chat, consider breaking into multiple messages
- If email is over 300 words, see if you can simplify

**Too short?**
- Make sure you fully answered the question
- Add helpful context if needed

---

### ✅ 10. Did I end with a closing question?

**Always ask:**
- "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
- "Do you have any other questions?"
- "Would you like me to help you with anything else?"

**Why?**
- Shows you're available for more help
- Prevents multiple back-and-forth messages
- Improves customer satisfaction

## Red Flags - DO NOT SEND if:

🚩 **You're not sure if the information is correct**
→ Verify first, then respond

🚩 **You're feeling frustrated or annoyed**
→ Take a break, then respond with fresh perspective

🚩 **The customer is asking for medical advice**
→ Use medical disclaimer template, don't provide advice

🚩 **You're making promises you can't keep**
→ Revise to be realistic and honest

🚩 **You're about to send a template without customization**
→ Personalize it first

🚩 **The response doesn't actually solve the problem**
→ Add a clear solution or next step

🚩 **You're unsure how to handle the situation**
→ Ask a supervisor before responding

## Remember

**Quality over speed.**

It's better to take an extra 2 minutes to send a high-quality response than to rush and send something that:
- Doesn't answer the question
- Contains errors
- Requires multiple follow-ups
- Frustrates the customer

**Every response represents Dr. Berg's brand.**

Make it count!
