# Why was Zinc, Vitamin D3 and Vitamin B6 added to Magnesium Glycinate formula?

Adding vitamin D3, zinc, and vitamin B6 to a magnesium glycinate supplement can offer several potential synergistic benefits. Here's a breakdown:Zinc (10mg zinc picolinate) and Magnesium (120mg magnesium glycinate): Zinc and magnesium are both essential minerals that participate in numerous biochemical processes. They often work together to support overall health. Zinc, in particular, plays a role in regulating neurotransmitters, which can contribute to improved sleep quality and a sense of calm. Vitamin B6 (6.5mg pyridoxal-5-phosphate) and Magnesium: Vitamin B6 plays a role in facilitating the uptake of magnesium into cells. This means it can potentially improve how efficiently your body uses the magnesium you consume, which is also important for muscle relaxation and sleep. Vitamin D3 (2.5 mcg D3 cholecalciferol) and Magnesium: Magnesium is essential for the activation of vitamin D. So, ensuring adequate magnesium levels is crucial for vitamin D to function properly.This creates a beneficial loop, where each supports the other's effectiveness.
