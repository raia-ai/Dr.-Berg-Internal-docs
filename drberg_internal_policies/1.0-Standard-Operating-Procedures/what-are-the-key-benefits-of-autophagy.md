# What are the key benefits of autophagy?

Autophagy means “self-eat.” This is the state in which your body begins to recycle damaged proteins and pathogens. When proteins become damaged, they can wreak havoc in your body. To prevent this harm, your body uses autophagy to break down damaged proteins with enzymes and to create new healthy proteins.Benefits:Reduces inflammationIncreases your lifespan and healthPrevents cancerSlows down the aging processDecreases the risk of diseaseHelps to recycle protein as a survival mechanismHelps to reduce pathogens in the bodyProtects neurons and heart cellsGets rid of advanced glycation end products and amyloid plaquingHelps you deal with • viruses • bacteria • fungus • candida • biofilms/nanobacteriahttps://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-is-autophagy-the-real-reason-why-it-exists-drberg
