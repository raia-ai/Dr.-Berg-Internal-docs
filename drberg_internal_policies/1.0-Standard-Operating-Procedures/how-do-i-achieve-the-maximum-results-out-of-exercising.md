# How do I achieve the maximum results out of exercising?

Exercise comes down to two different types, anaerobic and aerobic. Understanding these two types of exercise will give you the ability to adjust your workout to your needs and maximize your results. Anaerobic exercise: Without oxygen Duration: short Intensity: high Recovery: long Frequency: less often Goal: increasing muscle growth, strength, and speedAerobic exercise: With oxygen Duration: long Intensity: low Recovery: short Frequency: more often Goal: endurance You'll see the most benefits if you do both anaerobic and aerobic exercises. This combination will help you maintain your muscles and endurance. If you build up to doing the high-intensity workout required for anaerobic exerciseâ€”you only need to do the workout one to two times per week. A good example of a high-intensity workout is high-intensity interval training or HIIT. On the other days of the week, you need to recover or try aerobic exercise. You can do aerobic exercise three to seven days a week.
