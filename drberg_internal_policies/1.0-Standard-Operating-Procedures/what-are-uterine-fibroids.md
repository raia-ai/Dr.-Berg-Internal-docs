# What are uterine fibroids?

Here's the deal: Up to half of all women may develop fibroids, which are noncancerous growths in the uterus, by age 50.Good news: Research suggests vitamin D might help shrink fibroids. Women with sufficient vitamin D levels seem to have a lower risk of developing them. Vitamin D might work by affecting enzymes related to estrogen and potentially even causing fibroid cells to die off.Important Note: While Dr. Bruce Hollis has explored the benefits of vitamin D, some relevant research hasn't been widely accepted yet.Dosing: While high doses (around 50,000 IU) of vitamin D have been suggested for fibroids, it's crucial to consult a doctor before taking such a high dosage. They can advise on the appropriate amount based on your individual needs and test results.Additional Support: Some recommend including specific nutrients alongside vitamin D, such as vitamin K2, magnesium, zinc, vitamin B6, and boron. Again, discuss these with your doctor for personalized recommendations.Natural Approaches: In addition to vitamin D, some dietary changes might be helpful. Consider a ketogenic diet, which emphasizes healthy fats, and increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Limiting dairy might also be beneficial.Remember: This information shouldn't replace professional medical advice. Always consult your doctor about fibroids and treatment options.
