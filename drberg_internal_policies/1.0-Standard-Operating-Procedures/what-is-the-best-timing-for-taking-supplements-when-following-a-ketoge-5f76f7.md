# What is the best timing for taking supplements when following a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The best time to take your supplements is during the maximum absorption time. This occurs when you consume your first meal of the day.If you’re doing intermittent fasting, your first meal of the day may be a little later, but it’s still the perfect time! During your first meal of the day, you're considered insulin-sensitive. The more you fast, the more insulin-sensitive you become. Insulin is the key that allows fuel, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and trace minerals into the cell. When you are more sensitive to insulin, more nutrients are able to enter your cells. The more frequently you eat, the more your body becomes resistant to insulin, and the fewer nutrients you will absorb. There are two exceptions where you wouldn’t consume a supplement during your first meal. Certain nutrients are best absorbed when consumed on an empty stomach and some nutrients are better taken before bed to help with sleep. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/fixed-march-6-when-to-take-your-vitamins
