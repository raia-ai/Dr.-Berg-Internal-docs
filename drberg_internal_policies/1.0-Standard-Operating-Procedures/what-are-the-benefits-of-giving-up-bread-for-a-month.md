# What are the benefits of giving up bread for a month?

Consuming bread can elevate blood sugar levels and introduce glyphosate, an herbicide linked to health issues. Gluten in bread, especially wheat, is incompletely digested and associated with conditions like celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Even without noticeable gastrointestinal symptoms, gluten can affect the body, potentially contributing to conditions such as diabetes, Hashimoto's, psoriasis, and mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. It may also impact neurological functions and reproductive health.
