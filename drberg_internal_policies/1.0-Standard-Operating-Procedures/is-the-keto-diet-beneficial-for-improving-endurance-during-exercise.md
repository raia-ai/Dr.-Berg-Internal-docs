# Is the keto diet beneficial for improving endurance during exercise?

Traditionally, it was believed that endurance athletes primarily relied on glucose for fuel. When glycogen stores were depleted, athletes often experienced fatigue, commonly referred to as "hitting the wall." This understanding has led many athletes to consume carbohydrates before, during, and after exercise. However, recent research indicates that utilizing fat as a primary fuel source through ketosis may be advantageous.Achieving this requires becoming fully keto-adapted, a crucial aspect that has often been overlooked. Studies have shown that elite endurance athletes who are adapted to ketosis can burn over twice the amount of fat compared to those who consume a carbohydrate-rich diet. This shift in metabolic fuel may enhance endurance and overall athletic performance.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/why-should-endurance-athletes-choose-a-ketogenic-diet-drberg
