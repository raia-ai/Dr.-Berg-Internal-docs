# Which supplement can assist with cataracts?

N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) is recognized for its potent antioxidant properties, which are beneficial in addressing glycation within the eye lens. The "C" component of NAC, carnosine, is particularly effective in this regard. The "N" component, acetyl, facilitates the delivery of carnosine into the eye, which can be challenging to achieve due to the lens's unique structure.When dealing with cataracts, targeting the affected tissue directly is crucial. NAC is an excellent choice for this purpose, as it can penetrate the lens effectively and address the opacity caused by advanced glycation end products (AGEs). However, it's important to note that there are different types of NAC available, and selecting the correct one is essential for optimal results. For detailed guidance on how to use NAC for cataracts, please refer to the comprehensive video I have created on this topic.While there are no guarantees, using NAC offers a promising approach to improving cataracts, especially when other methods have not yielded satisfactory results. Its ability to penetrate the lens and specifically target the glycation-related issues makes it a valuable option worth considering.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-1-ultimate-cure-for-cataracts-dr-berg-explains-1080p
