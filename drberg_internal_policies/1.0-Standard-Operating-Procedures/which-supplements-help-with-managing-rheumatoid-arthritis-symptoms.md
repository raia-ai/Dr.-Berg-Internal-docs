# Which supplements help with managing rheumatoid arthritis symptoms?

Certainly! Here's a condensed version:Hormone Precursors for Health- Vitamin D: Consider high doses of 30,000 to 40,000 IU to support overall health.- Pregnenolone: Essential for hormone production, especially cortisol. Levels decline with age, impacting health. Supplementing can help maintain hormone balance, crucial as people age.- Cholesterol: A precursor to pregnenolone and other hormones. Diets low in fat or cholesterol, like those on statins, can hinder hormone production. Increasing dietary cholesterol or using pregnenolone supplements can support hormone levels naturally.- Dosage: Start with 25 mg of pregnenolone and gradually increase to avoid hormonal imbalance, particularly in women adjusting to changes during menopause.These strategies aim to optimize hormone production and support overall health, especially in aging populations facing hormonal decline.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/best-tip-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-joint-pain-relief-by-drberg
