# If I am taking both Adrenal & Cortisol Support and Ashwagandha with Black Pepper, could I be taking too much ashwagandha?

Too much ashwagandha can lead to digestive issues. We advise following daily serving size recommendations and consulting a medical professional prior to combining or adding any supplements to your routine.
