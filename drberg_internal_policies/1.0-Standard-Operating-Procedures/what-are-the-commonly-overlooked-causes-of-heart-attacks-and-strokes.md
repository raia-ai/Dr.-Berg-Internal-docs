# What are the commonly overlooked causes of heart attacks and strokes?

Dr. Thomas Levy reported that 78% of patients with myocardial infarctions and occluded arteries also had DNA of pathogens typical for infections in root canal-treated teeth.This type of chronic infection is known as chronic apical periodontitis and often has no symptoms. As youâ€™re chewing, you push bacteria deeper into the lymphatic system, affecting the heart and causing other inflammatory issues like arthritis. Infected teeth are often missed on routine dental X-rays. C-reactive protein levels in your blood are a biomarker for inflammation and can sometimes signify infected teeth.The infection can be in the tooth, gums, jaw, or tonsils. Pathogens in your mouth can create significant oxidative stress and free radical damage. One of the ways your body responds is by developing clots. Other symptoms include fatigue, chronic inflammation, jaw problems, and tooth sensitivity. To strengthen your immune system and prevent the spread of bacteria from your teeth, take 1 to 2 grams (500 mg a few times a day) of liposomal vitamin C. Vitamin C works as an antioxidant to lower oxidative stress in the body. Liposomal vitamin C is one of the only forms that can work at the intracellular level. Liposomal vitamin C will not cause diarrhea, even when taken in large quantities.
