# Why do I sleep better in a cold room?

The temperature in your environment affects the hormone melatonin. Melatonin is a sleep hormone. Cool temperatures can increase melatonin, and melatonin can cause your body to run cooler at night. Melatonin is also affected by light. When it’s dark out, melatonin increases and helps you fall asleep. If you have sleep problems or you want to help improve your sleep quality, you may want to try adjusting your room temperature to 60-68 degrees Fahrenheit (15-20 degrees Celsius) at night. A few things that can affect sleep: • Memory foam mattresses can contain heat. You may want to get a different mattress or get a gel topper to help keep it cool. • Fans can help keep it cool. • Keeping your feet out of the covers may also help keep you cool. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/why-do-you-sleep-better-in-a-cold-room
