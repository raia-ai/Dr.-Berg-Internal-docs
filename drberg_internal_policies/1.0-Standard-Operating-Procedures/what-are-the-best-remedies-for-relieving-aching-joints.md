# What are the best remedies for relieving aching joints?

Boron, a trace mineral needed in smaller amounts, plays multiple beneficial roles in the body. It functions as an enzyme co-factor essential for the production of cortisol and other steroid hormones. Boron supports post-menopausal health by enhancing estrogen and testosterone levels, and it aids in vitamin D metabolism. Additionally, boron may assist in managing conditions like erectile dysfunction and has natural antimicrobial properties, potentially beneficial for combating toenail fungus. Moreover, it facilitates the absorption of calcium and magnesium, contributing to bone health and overall joint support. Integrating boron-rich foods or supplements into your diet can help alleviate joint discomfort and promote overall well-being.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/aching-joints-this-miracle-mineral-could-end-your-suffering-drberg
