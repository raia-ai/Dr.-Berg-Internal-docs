# What are the best methods to regrow hair during and after hair loss?

Hair loss typically stems from two main causes: nutritional deficiencies and hormone imbalances. Nutritional deficits, including trace minerals, collagen types 1 and 3, silica, biotin, and B-vitamins, can contribute significantly to hair thinning. Hormone imbalances, often related to elevated levels of DHT, a potent form of testosterone, also play a role. Addressing these issues can be achieved through dietary adjustments that prioritize trace minerals, nutritional yeast for B-vitamins, vitamin C, silica, and supplements like stinging nettle root, known for their hair-regrowing properties.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-to-regrow-hair-the-two-causes-of-hair-loss-drberg
