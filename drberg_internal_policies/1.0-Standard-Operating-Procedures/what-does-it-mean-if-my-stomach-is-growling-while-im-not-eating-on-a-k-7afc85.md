# What does it mean if my stomach is growling while I'm not eating on a ketogenic diet?

Stomach sounds or growling often result from the migrating motor complex (MMC), a process that clears debris and excess food from the digestive tract. This function is crucial for preventing Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), which occurs when excessive bacteria populate the small intestine, leading to nutrient malabsorption and bloating.Strategies to Reduce Stomach Growling:1. Eat Regularly: Consuming food can reduce growling; however, if SIBO is present, eating may worsen bloating.2. Increase Bile Salts: Supports digestion and nutrient absorption.3. Manage Stress: Reducing stress can enhance digestive health.4. Address SIBO: Increase bile production and consider taking betaine hydrochloride.5. Incorporate Intermittent Fasting: This can support digestive health and the MMC function.Implementing these strategies can help manage stomach sounds and improve overall digestive well-being.
