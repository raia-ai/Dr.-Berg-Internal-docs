# Can fruit extract raise blood sugar levels?

Many fruit extracts contain fructose, a natural sugar. While fructose does not directly spike blood sugar levels like glucose, it is processed by the liver. Over time, excessive fructose consumption can lead to insulin resistance, which indirectly raises blood sugar levels.Glucose ContentSome fruit extracts may also contain glucose, which directly increases blood sugar levels and triggers insulin release.Concentrated SugarsFruit extracts are often concentrated, meaning they may contain higher levels of natural sugars compared to whole fruits. This concentration can lead to a more significant impact on blood sugar levels.Considerations for Managing Blood SugarIf you have conditions like Type 2 Diabetes or are managing blood sugar levels, it's essential to monitor the type and amount of fruit extracts consumed.Opt for extracts with low or no added sugars and minimal fructose content.Always check the nutritional label for sugar content and consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
