# How does apple cider vinegar help you lose belly fat?

It is not that it does this directly, but indirectly and it's not even the vitamins and minerals in the apple cider vinegar, but something called acetic acid. This acid apparently has the ability to reduce resistance to insulin and increase glucose uptake by the muscle cells. It also lowers blood sugars and the need for the pancreas to make insulin. Less insulin, more fat burning, less fat storage in your belly. The other cool thing is that when insulin resistance improves, your ability to absorb vitamins, minerals, and protein (amino acids). Take 1 tablespoon of ACV in a glass of water. I like to also add lemon juice too - at 1 tsp. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/why-apple-cider-vinegar-helps-you-lose-belly-fat-acv-for-weight-loss-drberg
