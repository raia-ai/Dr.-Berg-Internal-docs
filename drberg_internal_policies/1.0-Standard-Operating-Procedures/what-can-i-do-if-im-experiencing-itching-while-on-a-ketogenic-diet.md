# What can I do if Iâ€™m experiencing itching while on a ketogenic diet?

1. Allergies (compare what you are currently eating to your past eating to try to isolate something new - this could be an allergy. Just avoid it to see if things improve).2. B-vitamin deficiency - low B vitamins can create all sorts of skin issues.3. Gallbladder or Liver - if its congested, then you want to do things to improve it by spiking your vegetables.4. Toxins from the fat cell being released - if this is the case, add Bentonite Clay on an empty stomach helps pull them out by a mechanism called adsprption, whereby the the clay has the power to have up to 2000x its weight attract toxins like a magnet and pull them out.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/itching-on-keto-do-this
