# Why shouldnâ€™t someone use Electrolyte Powder after it has expired?

After a product's expiration date, we cannot ensure its full effectiveness. While it may still function, there is also a possibility it will not. If you decide to use an expired product and encounter any adverse effects, please keep in mind that it was used beyond its recommended expiration date.
