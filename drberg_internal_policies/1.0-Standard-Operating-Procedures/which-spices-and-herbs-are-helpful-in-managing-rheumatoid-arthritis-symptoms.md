This means that your own immune system is attacking itself—mainly the joints. There is a lot of inflammation going on, and it’s really the immune system causing the damage. With rheumatoid arthritis, you have a big problem with the T cells. These cells are doing a lot of destruction to your joints. There is also a certain T cell that is supposed to turn off this immune reaction, and I think this could be where the bigger problem is—it’s not balancing the reaction. By using certain spices and herbs, you can help decrease the inflammatory process that’s creating the damage. You could also help strengthen the immune system and improve the antimicrobial function.
