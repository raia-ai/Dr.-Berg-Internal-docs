# Is the ketogenic diet safe for people with high cholesterol levels?

Yes. By doing the healthy version of keto, you can get into ketosis and start burning fat. There will be certain times when your cholesterol goes up and down. But as long as you keep your carbs low, you’ll have your cholesterol regulated.The fat cell is made up of triglycerides (which is used as fuel) and cholesterol (which can’t be used as fuel).If you have excess cholesterol, your body breaks it down with bile and dissolves it with an enzyme called lipase.If your cholesterol increases, it could be that your body is having a difficult time processing excess cholesterol due to liver damage.Fatty liver, scar tissue, inflammation, endotoxins can all cause liver problems. Not having a gallbladder can also cause high levels of cholesterol.Here’s what you can do to help normalize your cholesterol levels:Consume plenty of vegetables (at least 7 cups per day)Take bile saltsUse cholineTake niacin (vitamin B3)As you adapt to a Healthy Keto® diet, your cholesterol will naturally normalize on its own. Keto helps decrease liver fat, increase liver function, and increase bile production. So if you’re not already on keto, check out some of Dr. Berg’s keto videos to get started.
