# What drinks are allowed during a fast?

Consuming anything that causes a spike in insulin will break your fast. Many beverages can trigger an insulin spike, ending your fast. However, consuming water, with or without lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, can have many health benefits and will not spike insulin levels. Black coffee is also acceptable, and adding butter or cream to the coffee in moderation may be okay as well. Electrolytes without added sugars are usually okay, as are herbal teas. Remember to check the ingredients of beverages prior to consumption to make sure they won't spike your insulin and break your fast, like soda, diet soda, bone broth, coconut water, alcohol, or milk.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-should-you-drink-during-fasting-acceptable-liquids-drberg
