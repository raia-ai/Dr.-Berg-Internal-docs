# What should I do after completing a 24-hour fast?

Eating too much too quickly after a 24-hour fast can cause gastrointestinal issues such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Start with small and easy-to-digest foods like soups or smoothies and gradually introduce solid foods over several hours.
