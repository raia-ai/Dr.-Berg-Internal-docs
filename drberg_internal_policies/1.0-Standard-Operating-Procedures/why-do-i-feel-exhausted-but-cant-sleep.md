# Why do I feel exhausted but canâ€™t sleep?

Being unable to fall asleep despite feeling exhausted can be caused by snacking too close to bedtime, consuming alcohol, frequent need to urinate at night, blood sugar imbalances, and vitamin D deficiency. In some cases, being unable to sleep can be a symptom of a sleep disorder such as sleep apnea, circadian rhythm disorder, or hormonal imbalances.
