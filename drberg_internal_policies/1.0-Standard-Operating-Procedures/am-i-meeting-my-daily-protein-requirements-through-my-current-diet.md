# Am I meeting my daily protein requirements through my current diet?

Typically, the minimum amount of protein a person needs is 50 grams. You might think that if you consume a beef steak that’s 100 grams or 3.5 ounces, you’re getting double the amount of protein you need for the day.However, there is a difference between the weight of a steak and the amount of protein in the steak. For example, a steak that weighs 100 grams only contains 26 grams of protein. This is because steak also contains fat and water. Proteins also vary in amino acids. We don’t even really have a daily requirement for protein—we actually have a daily requirement for amino acids in the protein. The problem lies in the quality of protein or the bioavailable acids in the food you eat.While some plants have protein, animal sources are a better option for protein than plant sources. Also, know that many infant formulas and foods for toddlers are loaded with soy protein and other plant proteins that can cause problems with digestion.Foods high in protein: 1. Breast milk 2. Eggs 3. Meat 4. Chicken 5. Dairy
