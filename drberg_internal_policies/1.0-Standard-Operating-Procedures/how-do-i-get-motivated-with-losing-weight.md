They don't see results. They're working hard, and it's not working. It's normal to stop something if it's not working. It may actually be good that you stopped because it's not working.2. They don't know what to do. They don't have a plan. They need to find someone who has done it successfully and follow them.3. Cravings. It's not normal to crave anything unless your body is out of balance. They need to consume more vegetables. After that, if the cravings are still there, they need to add more protein. They also need to focus on getting rid of stress and getting more sleep. Creating goals along the weight loss journey will also help with weight loss motivation.
