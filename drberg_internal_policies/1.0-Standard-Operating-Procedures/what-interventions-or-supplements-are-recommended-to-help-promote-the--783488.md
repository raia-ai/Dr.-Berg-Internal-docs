# What interventions or supplements are recommended to help promote the decalcification of arterial plaque?

Healthy keto and intermittent fasting help to reduce your insulin levels and lessen the damage to your artery wall. In addition to keto and intermittent fasting, you can up your intake of certain nutrients that help decalcify your arteries.The coronary artery calcium (CAC) test measures the amount of calcium in your coronary arteries and gives you a baseline when you start your healthy eating lifestyle. Your goal is to have a score as close to zero as possible. These are the four nutrients that can help decalcify your arteries. The first is vitamin K2, a fat-soluble vitamin that transports excess calcium from your arteries to your bones. Try the natural version, MK-7.Next is vitamin D3, another fat-soluble vitamin. Vitamin D3 works with vitamin K2 to transport calcium. Try taking them with a meal, and not on an empty stomach, so they’ll be absorbed better. Third is magnesium, which helps bring down excess levels of calcium.Fourth is IP-6 or phytic acid. It’s an excellent inhibitor of calcification in your arteries because it’s a chelator. This means it binds with calcium and other minerals like iron, and helps to pull them from your arteries. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/4-ways-to-decalcify-your-arteries-drberg
