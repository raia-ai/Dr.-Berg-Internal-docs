# What should I do if I have bloating, constipation, and acid reflux?

One of the main purposes of the stomach is to break down proteins and absorb minerals. It needs to be very acid. If the pH of the stomach is not acidic enough, you wonâ€™t be able to release bile from the gallbladder. Bile is a fluid that helps you break down fats, and without it you may experience bloating, constipation, acid reflux, and many other digestive issues.Taking Gallbladder Formula will help your body cope with the lack of bile, supporting healthy digestion. Advanced Digestive Formula contains apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride, which support the health of your stomach and can help with these digestion related symptoms.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/bloating-indigestion-constipation-acid-reflux-drberg
