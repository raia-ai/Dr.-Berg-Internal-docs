# Is ketogenic diet heart-healthy?

Yes. One of the main causes of heart disease is high insulin, and the ketogenic diet is designed to lower insulin.There was a study done on rodents, where, as a result of a keto diet, there was an increase in cholesterol, an increase in LDL, a decrease in HDL and an increase in triglycerides. However, in humans, it had the opposite effect. There was a decrease in cholesterol, a decrease in LDL, an increase in HDL and a decrease in triglycerides.In rodents, the keto diet increased insulin. But in humans, it decreases insulin, blood sugar levels and even A1C. To take it to the next level and lower your insulin even more, you may want to also do intermittent fasting.*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/keto-and-heart-disease-drberg-answers-does-ketogenic-diet-increase-or-decrease-heart-health
