# Why did I develop a rash after starting a ketogenic diet, and how can I correct it?

Dr. Berg’s theory for what causes the “keto rash” is that it’s due to a bile deficiency or vitaminB2 (riboflavin) deficiency.On the ketogenic diet, your total caloric intake of fat can be anywhere from 70-80% which is different from what you are used to consuming. If your body has not adapted to produce enough bile to release toxins coming out with the fat in a proper manner then this can create an immune reaction like itching or rashes that come from high histamines dumping from the liver and gallbladder.Bile is made by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Its job is to increase flow, helping to break down fats, eliminate toxins and absorb fat-soluble vitamins. If you are not absorbing those fat-soluble vitamins, then you will be low in vitamin A, D and E – which are all related to skin health.To correct this you can take bile salts or Dr. Berg’s Gallbladder Formula after every meal, or you can temporarily reduce the amount of fats you are consuming.If you have a B2 deficiency it can also cause skin issues. To correct this you can take nutritional yeast to help correct the deficiency. If you are very deficient you can take activated B2 separately as a supplement.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/keto-rash-is-a-bile-deficiency-bile-salts-dietary-fats-keto-rash-drberg
