# Am I going to gain weight on fruits and vegetables?

Weight gain from vegetables depends on amount and frequency. Leafy greens, like 7 cups of salad, have minimal carbs (3.8 grams net carbs) and won't significantly impact insulin. Any weight gain is likely due to bloating or fluid retention, not fat. If you experience digestive issues, reduce vegetable intake or address possible SIBO.Fruits can cause weight gain if consumed frequently in large amounts. Snacking on fruits regularly can increase weight, as seen from personal experience. Historically, wild fruits and vegetables had lower sugar and higher fiber content, making them less likely to contribute to weight gain.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/is-it-possible-to-gain-weight-on-fruits-and-vegetables-drberg
