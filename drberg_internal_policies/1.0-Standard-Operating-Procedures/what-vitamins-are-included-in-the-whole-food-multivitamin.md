# What vitamins are included in the Whole Food Multivitamin?

We designed Dr. Berg Whole Food Multivitamin with Minerals based on the latest metabolic research to provide you with a reliable and convenient source of nutrition. This exclusive blend packs a punch when it comes to highly-concentrated nutrients. Each daily dose contains the four fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K and is packed with vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B7 (biotin), vitamin B9 (folate) and vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin). Many vitamins and phytochemicals are heat-sensitive and quickly degrade. That’s why we use a minimally-processed superfood blend to preserve crucial nutrients. Whole Food Multivitamin and Minerals also includes our comprehensive trace mineral complex and advanced Krebs cycle powder to unlock your body’s full potential.
