# Which one is healthier whole wheat bread or white bread?

The glycemic index is a scale that measures how fast food turns into sugar and raises your blood sugar. It turns out whole wheat bread and white bread are almost identical on the glycemic index. They are both highly glycemic and turn to sugar pretty fast. Not only that, but they can increase bad cholesterol. Whole wheat bread is less refined, but it may have more preservatives in it. Both white bread and whole wheat bread have gluten, which can potentially cause certain health problems. Whole wheat bread has phytic acid, which could prevent the absorption of minerals. Any nutrition in whole wheat is also likely gone by the time you eat the whole wheat bread anyway. If you're going to eat bread, you may want to try Ezekiel bread instead of whole wheat bread or white bread. This is a sprouted bread. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-difference-between-brown-bread-and-white-bread-which-one-is-better-drberg
