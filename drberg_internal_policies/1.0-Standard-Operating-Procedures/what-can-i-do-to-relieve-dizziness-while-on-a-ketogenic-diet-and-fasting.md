# What can I do to relieve dizziness while on a ketogenic diet and fasting?

I think that you definitely need electrolytes, but it could be you need more salt and sea salt. That's really the key thing with feeling dizzy and disoriented, especially if you're drinking a lot of water and you start keto, because you dump all this fluid and now we also dump all the electrolytes. So if you're already doing sea salt, then I would do the potassium electrolyte drink. I only recommend that if you're very deficient, but I think you may wanna just, with the electrolyte powder, take about an eighth of a teaspoon of sea salt and dissolve that into the electrolyte powder because it sounds like you need more sodium if you feel kind of dizzy and things like that. So do that a few times a day, because here's the thing, if you actually take a lot of potassium without that sodium that will make your sodium a little bit lower. So anything with dizziness, low blood pressure, I would go with that.The other thing you wanna realize is that you might need B1. B1 could also create that dizziness, especially if you get up and you feel disoriented and it's called POTS, but that's really a B1 deficiency if you feel lightheaded, especially if you get up too quickly.
