# Will I become fat if I eat a lot of protein?

Insulin converts food into fat and prevents fat release. Excessive protein triggers insulin but also glucagon, which helps burn fat. Eating protein with carbs leads to weight gain. Intermittent fasting may aid weight loss with high protein, but frequent meals can hinder it.Carbs, not protein, mainly cause weight gain due to insulin response. Too much protein can strain the stomach, causing fatigue, body odor, or kidney issues.Signs of excess protein: fatigue post-meal, foamy urine, constipation. Aim for 3-6 oz of protein per meal, adjusting based on fitness, metabolism, and digestion. Be mindful of excessive protein intake for overall health.
