# What strategies or lifestyle adjustments can help manage restless leg syndrome symptoms effectively?

To address restless leg syndrome, follow a healthy ketogenic diet as recommended. Refined carbohydrates, such as rice and pasta, deplete essential nutrients like vitamin B1 and potassium, which are crucial for managing this condition. Vitamin B1 helps eliminate lactic acid buildup in your legs. Reducing carbohydrate intake will enhance the effectiveness of these nutrients and alleviate symptoms. Give it some time, and you'll likely notice significant improvement.
