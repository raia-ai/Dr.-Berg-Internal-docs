# Whatâ€™s an effective way to calculate macronutrients on a ketogenic diet?

Keto macros are typically 5% carbs, 20% proteins, and 75% fats. Intermittent fasting adds layers to this plan by reducing meal frequency, which naturally decreases calorie intake and increases nutrient retention.For example, if you consume 1,800 calories with three meals per day, you might consume 1,500 calories with two meals and 1,200 calories with one meal. As meal frequency decreases, your body becomes more efficient at absorbing nutrients, so you need less food overall.Vegetable intake should adjust with meal frequency: - Three meals per day: 10 cups total (about 3.3 cups per meal)- Two meals per day: 8 cups total (4 cups per meal)- One meal per day: 7 cups totalKeep carbs under 20 grams per day, regardless of meal frequency, though up to 30 grams is acceptable.Protein intake should be:- 3-4 ounces per meal with three meals per day- 5 ounces per meal with two meals per day- 8 ounces with one meal per dayFat intake should be based on hunger:- 140 grams per day for three meals- 113 grams per day for two meals- 86 grams per day for one mealInitially, you will need more dietary fat, but as you progress, your body will use its own fat stores. Adjust fat intake to maintain satiety without feeling overly full.
