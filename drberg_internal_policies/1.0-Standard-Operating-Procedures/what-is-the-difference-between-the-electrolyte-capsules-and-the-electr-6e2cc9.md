# What is the difference between the Electrolyte Capsules and the Electrolyte Powder?

Our Electrolyte Capsules are unflavored or contain stevia, unlike our Electrolyte Powder. This allows for a more concentrated form of potassium, so you get a higher dose in each capsule without the need to take a handful.
