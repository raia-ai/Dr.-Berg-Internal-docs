# What potential benefits can apple cider vinegar offer when added to your hair and scalp care routine?

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has many benefits when used internally or externally. Healthy digestion and healthy blood sugar levels are just a few of the many potential health benefits of apple cider vinegar.Using apple cider vinegar for your hair can do several things, including: • Restoring the pH of your scalp• Giving your hair a nice shine• Cleaning up some of the residue left by shampoos and conditioners As a side note, I recommend getting a filter that can pull out chlorine and fluoride from your water. They are halogens, which can react with your skin and cause conditions like acne and damage your hair.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/is-it-safe-to-use-acv-apple-cider-vinegar-for-hair-drberg
