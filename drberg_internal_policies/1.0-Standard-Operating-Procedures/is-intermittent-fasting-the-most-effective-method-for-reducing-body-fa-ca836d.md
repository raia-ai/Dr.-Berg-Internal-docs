# Is intermittent fasting the most effective method for reducing body fat percentage?

Intermittent fasting is highly effective for reducing body fat percentage. Unlike a ketogenic diet, which lowers carbohydrate intake to promote fat burning, intermittent fasting directly addresses insulin levels by restricting eating periods. This approach can further enhance fat loss by minimizing insulin spikes and promoting greater fat utilization.To achieve optimal results, it is important to ease into intermittent fasting, maintain proper nutrition, and allow time for your body to adapt, typically within two to three days. Proper adaptation often leads to reduced appetite, making it easier to sustain the fasting regimen.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/fasting-and-visceral-belly-fat-the-correct-way
