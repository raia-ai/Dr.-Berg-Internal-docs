# Why am I not able to connect my Stress and Recovery Analyzer to Bluetooth?

For the Stress and Recovery Analyzer device (SRA Pulse Oximeter) to work, it does not need to connect or pair to Bluetooth within your system settings as a Bluetooth mouse, keyboard, or headphones may need to. The SRA Pulse Oximeter will automatically connect via Bluetooth when you run your first test within the Stress and Recovery Analyzer software.Attempting to connect the SRA Pulse Oximeter to Bluetooth within your computer's system settings before running a test within the Stress and Recovery software may create difficulties for the device to connect when you run your test within the software. If you have attempted to connect to Bluetooth through your system settings, it is recommended that you turn off Bluetooth and restart your system. Once your computer has restarted, turn Bluetooth on, open the Stress and Recovery Analyzer software, and run a test.Please note that Bluetooth LE functionality is needed for the SRA Pulse Oximeter to be recognized by the Stress and Recovery Analyzer software. If your computer is not equipped with an integrated Bluetooth LE module (most modern laptops and tablets have it), you must obtain an off-the-shelf Bluetooth LE USB adapter (dongle). They are widely available online and at local computer stores. Any such adapter should work with the SRA Pulse Oximeter.
