# Is it okay to sprinkle electrolyte powder over food?

No. Electrolyte powders should be dissolved in water, as they are designed to be taken this way. When mixed with water, the minerals are ionized, which makes them easier for the body to absorb. Dissolving the powder also ensures the minerals are diluted to a safe and effective concentration, reducing the risk of irritation or discomfort, particularly with ingredients like magnesium or potassium. Additionally, since electrolytes support hydration, consuming them with water is essential. Drinking the powder dry or with minimal fluid undermines its intended benefits. Electrolyte Powder also contains citric acid and natural flavoring, which can cause stomach discomfort if not properly diluted. Unless a product is specifically formulated to be taken directly, like our capsules, electrolyte powders should always be mixed with water.
