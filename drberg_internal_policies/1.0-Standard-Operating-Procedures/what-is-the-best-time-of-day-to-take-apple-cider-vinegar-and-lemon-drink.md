# What is the best time of day to take apple cider vinegar and lemon drink?

You just take it right before you eat. But you can also realize you're not taking it straight. You want to dilute it. A couple of tablespoons in a glass of water. It's not going to be straight, but that upside of vinegar right before you eat will be a good thing.
