# What are the most effective diet and exercise strategies for reducing stubborn belly fat?

Belly fat or visceral fat is fat that is outside of the fat cells—it’s in the organs, especially the liver. If you have belly fat, you have a fatty liver. Insulin resistance is what leads to fat on the liver to begin with. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone, and it prevents weight loss. Cortisol is another hormone that can make it difficult to lose weight.How to get rid of stubborn belly fat fast:1. Reduce stress and support sleep by doing aerobic exercise (long walks or physical work). Burn fat by doing high-intensity interval training without overtraining (two to three times a week).2.
