# What are the health benefits of COQ10?

CoQ10 is found in every single cell in the body. It’s a very powerful antioxidant, but its main job is to stabilize membranes, especially in areas of your body where you’re generating a lot of energy.The membrane around the mitochondria (the energy factory) needs CoQ10. Lipoprotein membranes, as in HDL and LDL, also need CoQ10. When you’re generating a lot of energy, you’re also generating a lot of free radical damage and oxidation. CoQ10 helps to counter that.Benefits:It can support the heartIt may be good for athletes, who generate a lot of oxidationIt may be good for people who have migraines or headachesIt may be good for people who have inflammationIt may be good for people who take a lot of medicationIt could potentially help protect against cancerHow to consume itFollow the directions on the label for the proper dosage. You should know that statins block CoQ10. Blocking this enzyme can create a lot of side effects, especially muscle damage. If you’re taking a statin, you may also want to take CoQ10. If you have any nutritional deficiencies, you may also be deficient in CoQ10 because they set you up for not creating CoQ10. If you have inflammatory conditions, you may also want to take CoQ10.Where to get itYou can get it at a health food store or order it online.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-is-coq10-drberg-shares-coenzyme-coq10-benefits
