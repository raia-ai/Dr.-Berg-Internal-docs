# Is it possible to treat hair loss with home remedies?

Many top hair loss medications treat hair loss by blocking an enzyme (5-alpha reductase) to inhibit DHT. DHT is a powerful form of testosterone that can burn out hair follicles. People with too much DHT can develop androgenetic alopecia or pattern hair loss. Onion juice, green tea, rosemary oil, and zinc can help inhibit 5-alpha reductase. Fluoride from your water as well as sulfates from your shampoo can also potentially lead to hair loss. Try getting a shower head that filters out fluoride and use sulfate-free shampoo.
