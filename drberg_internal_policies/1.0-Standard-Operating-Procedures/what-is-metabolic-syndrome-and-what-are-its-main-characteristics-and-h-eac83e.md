# What is metabolic syndrome, and what are its main characteristics and health risks?

Metabolic syndrome encompasses several health issues:- High lipids- High blood sugar- Insulin resistance or diabetes- High blood pressure- ObesityA more accurate term might be hyperinsulinemia syndrome. The conventional view suggests insulin resistance leads to increased insulin, but evidence points to high insulin causing insulin resistance. Consider gastric bypass surgery, which bypasses part of the small intestine affecting insulin production. This surgery reduces high insulin levels, consequently decreasing type 2 diabetes by 83%, high blood pressure by 63%, and high cholesterol by 61%. It also improves conditions like sleep apnea, PCOS, fatty liver, GERD, and joint pain.High insulin over time causes the body to resist it, creating a vicious cycle of increasing insulin resistance. Poor dietary habits, such as frequent eating and consuming excessive carbohydrates and sugar, perpetuate this cycle. Unfortunately, many doctors do not connect these dots.
