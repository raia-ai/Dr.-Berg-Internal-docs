# What causes PCOS, and what factors contribute to its development?

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition in which the ovaries produce too-high amounts of androgens, which are the male sex hormones. (They are usually present in women, but in small amounts.) As a result the ovaries can develop cysts.Symptoms:Cysts in the ovariesFacial or body hairBelly fatLosing hairDeeper voiceCause #1: High insulinHigh Insulin is the primary cause of PCOS. If you consume too many carbs your body will produce more Insulin to lower the blood sugars. Insulin, in its turn, will increase the production of androgens in your body.Cause #2: Androgens are not converting to estrogenBoth androgens (male sex hormones) and estrogen (female sex hormone) are vital for the human body, especially if the amount of each is in balance with the other. A female body normally would convert androgens into estrogen. However, if you consume certain foods (for example GMO foods), these can block the conversion.Cause #3: StressOur adrenals (stress-regulating glands) have another function: they produce androgens in the body. If you are undergoing chronic stress it can result in overwork of the adrenals, which in its turn will cause high amounts of androgens.
