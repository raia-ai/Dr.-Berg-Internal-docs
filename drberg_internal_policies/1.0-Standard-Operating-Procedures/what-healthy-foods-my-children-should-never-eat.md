# What "healthy" foods my children should never eat?

There are a lot of so-called "health foods" out there for kids that are actually just junk. They can even create a lot of health problems. Foods to avoid for kids: 1. Juice Juice has high quantities of sugar, which is bad for the pancreas and might lead to other health problems related to high sugar at a later stage. 2. Flavored yogurt Flavored yogurt has lots of sugar (4 times more than plain yogurt) and should be avoided for healthy nutrition for kids. 3. Weight gain shakes Weight gain shakes have so much hidden sugar along with synthetic vitamins. The best foods for kids to gain weight would be potatoes, sweet potatoes, and yams. 4. Whole grains Whole grains such as breads, biscuits, pancakes should be avoided. These are the worst foods for kids and should only be consumed in very small amounts. These foods can lead to blood sugar problems and obesity later on. Healthy meals for kids should include proteins, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds that will provide them with the essential nutrients they need. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-worst-health-foods-for-kids-drberg
