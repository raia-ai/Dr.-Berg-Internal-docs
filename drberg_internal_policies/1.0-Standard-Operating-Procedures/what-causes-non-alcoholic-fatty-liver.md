# What causes non-alcoholic fatty liver?

25% of the world population (adults only) has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. 40% of the US population (adults only) actually has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It’s very common, but in most cases, there are no symptoms. There are two types of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: 1. Fat only 2. Fat and inflammation Insulin converts glucose to triglycerides. I believe high levels of insulin are what’s causing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Carbohydrates (especially fructose and omega 6 fatty acids) are what’s behind high insulin. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic fatty liver disease have different causes but the same effects. This could mean that fructose, omega-6 fatty acids, and other refined carbohydrates have a very similar effect as alcohol on the liver. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/why-does-a-fatty-liver-have-no-symptoms-nafld-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-by-drberg
