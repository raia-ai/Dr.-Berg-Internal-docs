# What is the most commonly overlooked cause of hypertension?

One of the most overlooked causes of hypertension is zinc deficiency. Regions with zinc-deficient soils, particularly in Southern states, show higher rates of hypertension and strokes. Zinc deficiency can impair taste and smell, leading to increased salt consumption and cravings for junk food, which may exacerbate hypertension. This mineral is crucial for nitric oxide production, necessary for relaxing blood vessels, and for antioxidants that combat inflammation. Medications like ACE inhibitors can further deplete zinc levels, potentially worsening blood pressure. Ensuring adequate intake from sources like oysters, shellfish, and red meat is essential to support overall cardiovascular health.
