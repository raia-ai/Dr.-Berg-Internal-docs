# I’ve noticed significant volume loss in my face—will this naturally improve over time?

If you've lost facial volume, it may be due to water and fluid loss, often seen with keto diets as the body sheds excess glycogen. To help restore some of this volume, consider increasing your electrolyte intake, especially sea salt, to retain more fluid. This approach is similar to how bodybuilders use carb-loading to increase muscle fullness, but instead, you're using fluid and electrolytes. As you continue on a healthy path, your appearance should improve, and adding exercise to build muscle can further support a more vibrant look.
