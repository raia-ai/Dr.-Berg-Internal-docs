# What steps should I take if I'm having trouble with bowel movements?

If you're struggling with constipation, the culprit might be your diet. Processed foods and nutrient deficiencies can disrupt healthy digestion, leading to discomfort and irregularity.Common constipation, not caused by underlying medical issues, is often treated with petroleum-based medications. However, these can have unwanted side effects. A more natural approach focuses on restoring gut health and optimizing your diet.Our gut microbes play a crucial role in breaking down fiber and maintaining healthy digestion. A lack of beneficial bacteria can contribute to constipation, bloating, and cramping.To address this, start by practicing intermittent fasting with two meals a day and no snacking. This allows your digestive system to rest and recuperate.Next, simplify your meals and eliminate processed foods. Focus on whole, nutrient-dense options like grass-fed meat and fermented foods like sauerkraut, which provide beneficial microbes. A Healthy KetoÂ® diet can further support gut health.Supplementing with betaine hydrochloride can boost stomach acid and improve digestion, potentially alleviating constipation by enhancing bile production.Additionally, incorporating plants grown in nutrient-rich soil can provide essential nutrients and beneficial microbes. Magnesium and vitamin B1 can promote regularity, while castor oil and senna offer natural relief.By addressing the root cause of constipation through dietary and lifestyle changes, you can achieve lasting relief and improve your overall well-being.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/youtube-videos-watch-this-if-you-can-t-go
