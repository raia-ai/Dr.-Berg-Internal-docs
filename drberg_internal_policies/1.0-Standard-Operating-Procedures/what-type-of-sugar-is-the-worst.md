# What type of sugar is the worst?

There are many different types of sugar, but the most common types of sugar are made up of glucose and fructose. Every cell in the body can metabolize glucose. But only the liver can break down fructose.Fructose doesn’t initially trigger insulin or increase blood sugar. However, fructose can lead to a fatty liver, inflammation, scar tissue, and damage to other parts of the body. As the liver becomes fatty, you could also develop insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and high uric acid levels. Uric acid is behind gout, certain types of kidney stones, and damage to the arteries. The body actually deals with fructose the same as it would with alcohol. Even though fructose is low on the glycemic index, it’s very deadly. Many types of sugar, like table sugar, honey, beet sugar, and high fructose corn syrup, are 50 percent glucose and 50 percent fructose. But agave nectar is 85 percent fructose.This makes agave nectar the worst type of sugar you could consume.
