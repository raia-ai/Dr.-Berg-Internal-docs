# What is a keto plateau, and how does it affect progress on the ketogenic diet?

Keto plateau is when you get into the ketogenic diet plan and you lose a lot of weight initially for the first few months, then weight loss starts slowing down. Losing weight is not a normal thing for the body, it is “anti-survival”. When you go on a low-calorie diet, your metabolism will adjust and will start slowing down, it will adapt and you eventually create what is called a set point, a weight that is almost impossible to bust through. High levels of insulin will counter the ability to burn fat because it prevents fat burning. And insulin resistance also comes with high levels of insulin. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/overcoming-keto-plateau-after-6-8-weeks-drberg
