# What are the clear signs that I’m in ketosis?

You can jumpstart ketosis by consuming coconut oil rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), strictly limiting your net carb intake to 20 grams per day, and practicing intermittent fasting to deplete blood sugar and glycogen stores. While testing your ketones initially can be helpful, long-term accuracy decreases as your body becomes more efficient at burning ketones. Fortunately, there are nine clear signs that indicate you’re in ketosis:Top Signs of Ketosis:1. No keto transitioning symptoms (like keto flu, fatigue, or rashes).2. Weight loss (initially from water weight).3. Loose clothes around the waist.4. Increased energy.5. Boost in cognitive function.6. Less inflammation and pain.7. Feeling satisfied after eating.8. Better mood.9. Decreased appetite.Types of Ketones:There are three types of ketones produced in the body:1. Acetate.2. Acetoacetate.3. Beta-hydroxybutyrate.Keto urine tests primarily detect acetoacetate but do not measure the other two forms. As you adapt to the keto diet, your body converts acetoacetate into beta-hydroxybutyrate, which means urine tests may not provide an accurate assessment of your ketone levels over time.For a more accurate measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate, blood tests are available, though they can be costly. Instead of relying solely on testing, focus on the signs of ketosis: if you’re losing weight, feeling good, and noticing a reduction in waist size while keeping your carb intake at 20 grams or less, you’re likely in fat-burning mode.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/9-signs-of-ketosis-fixed
