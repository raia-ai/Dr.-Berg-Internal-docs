# Are Dr. Berg Advisors able to advise a minor?

Dr. Berg Advisors are not able to advise anyone under the age of 18. Anyone under 18 must have a parent or legal guardian reach out to a Dr. Berg Advisor, who can then advise on a minor's concern, and the parent can relay and implement the information if they choose to.
