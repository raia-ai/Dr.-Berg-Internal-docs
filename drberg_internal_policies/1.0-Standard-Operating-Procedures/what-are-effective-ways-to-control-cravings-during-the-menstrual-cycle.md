# What are effective ways to control cravings during the menstrual cycle?

During a menstrual cycle, cravings can often be linked to fluctuations in serotonin levels, particularly if estrogen levels are low. Serotonin, crucial for mood regulation, is synthesized from tryptophan, whose conversion can be affected by estrogen levels. Symptoms like mood swings, headaches, and low libido may indicate low estrogen.To alleviate cravings:- Take L-tryptophan on an empty stomach to support serotonin production.- Address estrogen levels; reduce stress to lower cortisol, a potential inhibitor of estrogen, or manage androgens like testosterone, often elevated with high insulin levels.- Consider supplementing with high-quality flaxseed oil to support hormonal balance.Understanding these factors can help manage cravings effectively during the menstrual cycle, especially while following a keto diet and intermittent fasting regimen.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-to-get-rid-of-cravings-during-menstrual-cycle-with-one-nutrient-drberg
