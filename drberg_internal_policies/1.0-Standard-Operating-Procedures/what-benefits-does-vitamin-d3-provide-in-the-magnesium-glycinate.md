Vitamin D (from D3 cholecalciferol) Vitamin D3 and magnesium glycinate work together in a synergistic way to provide numerous health benefits due to their interconnected roles in the body: Magnesium Activates Vitamin D: Magnesium is a crucial cofactor for the enzymes that convert vitamin D into its active form, calcitriol. Without sufficient magnesium, vitamin D cannot be effectively utilized by the body. Vitamin D and Magnesium Absorption: Vitamin D supports the absorption of magnesium in the intestines, helping ensure adequate magnesium levels for various bodily functions. Bone Health: Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption, while magnesium helps to regulate calcium balance and deposit it into bones. This combination enhances bone mineralization, so adequate calcium and vitamin D throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.Muscle and Nerve Function: Both vitamin D and magnesium are essential for optimal muscle and nerve function. Magnesium helps with muscle contraction and relaxation, while vitamin D supports muscle strength and neuromuscular communication. Immune System Support: Vitamin D and magnesium are both involved in immune response regulation. Adequate levels of both nutrients may help boost immune system function.Cardiovascular Health: Magnesium helps regulate blood pressure and heart rhythm, while vitamin D supports cardiovascular health by maintaining healthy blood vessels and reducing temporary inflammation from exercise or physical activity. 7.
