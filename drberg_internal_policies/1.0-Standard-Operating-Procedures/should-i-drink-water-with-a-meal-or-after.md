# Should I drink water with a meal or after?

If you are going to drink water during your meal, add apple cider vinegar to help you keep the pH where it needs to be. Avoid adding calcium carbonate or drinking alkaline water to the meal because it will dilute it. But what’s more important is what you are eating or the quality of food you are consuming, and don’t force yourself to drink a lot of water especially when you ate protein because potentially, it can also dilute the HCL and weaken the ability to break down protein. If you are doing a salad with a meal or combining it with protein, you may find that you are thirstier at the end of the meal because a lot of the fiber attracts water and it gets up in the colon, so the body will tell you to drink a little more. If you have a weak digestive system or your stomach isn’t that strong with a good enough acid, don’t go drink too much water, and start to build it up with betaine hydrochloride, apple cider vinegar, or apple cider vinegar pillshttps://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/should-you-drink-water-with-your-meal-or-not-drberg
