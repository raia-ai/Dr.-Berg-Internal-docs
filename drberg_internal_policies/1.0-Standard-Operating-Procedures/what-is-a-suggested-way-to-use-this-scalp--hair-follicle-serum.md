# What is a suggested way to use this Scalp & Hair Follicle Serum?

Apply the oil to your scalp and gently massage it in with your fingertips using a circular motion for 10 to 15 minutes. Use the oil left on your palms to coat the rest of your hair. Leave the hair serum on overnight and wash it off with shampoo the next day.
