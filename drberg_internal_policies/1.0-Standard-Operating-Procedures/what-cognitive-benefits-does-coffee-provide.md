# What cognitive benefits does coffee provide?

If you're a coffee enthusiast, you might be pleased to know that your daily brew offers more than just a morning boost. Coffee consumption is linked to cognitive benefits that enhance mental acuity and focus.Coffee’s primary cognitive advantage comes from caffeine’s ability to block adenosine, a neurotransmitter that induces sleepiness. This inhibition increases alertness and improves learning capabilities, enhancing reaction time, vigilance, and logical reasoning.Furthermore, regular coffee intake has been associated with reduced risks of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies suggest that drinking 3-5 cups of coffee daily during midlife may lower the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease by up to 65%. Additionally, higher coffee and caffeine consumption is linked to a significantly lower incidence of Parkinson's disease.Beyond caffeine, coffee contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that may help prevent brain plaque buildup associated with Alzheimer’s. Caffeine is also found in various plants, so while coffee is a prominent source, you can obtain similar benefits from tea, chocolate, and some soft drinks in moderation.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-is-caffeine-how-does-it-works-drberg
