# Which ice cream options are considered healthy?

Not all ice creams are created equal when it comes to your health.The Unhealthiest:Ben & Jerry's: Loaded with sugars (around 35 teaspoons per pint!) and carbs.Breyers: High in carbs and sugar, uses high fructose corn syrup. Even their "Carb Smart" option contains questionable ingredients like maltitol and sucralose.The Better, But Not Best:Haagen-Dazs: Less sugar than Ben & Jerry's, but still a significant amount.Keto Ice Cream: While lower in sugar, it's high in sugar alcohols, which can cause digestive problems for some.The "Not Quite Ice Cream":Simple Truth: High in fiber and sugar alcohols, and technically not ice cream due to low milkfat content.The Best Choice:Rebel: Zero sugar and uses natural sweeteners like monk fruit. A great option for those watching their sugar intake.Homemade Ice Cream: The healthiest option, especially when made with natural sweeteners like allulose or honey (though honey isn't strictly keto).Key Takeaways:Always read the ingredients list, even if a product claims to be "keto" or "healthy."Sugar alcohols can be problematic for some people's digestion.Homemade ice cream allows you to control the ingredients and sweetness level.Healthy Homemade Ice Cream Recipe (Keto-Friendly Option):Ingredients:1 cup organic grass-fed heavy cream2 pasture-raised, organic egg yolks3 tbsp powdered allulose (or 1 tbsp honey for a less strictly keto option)1 pinch sea salt1 tbsp pure vanilla extractÂ½ cup pecans or walnuts (optional)Instructions:Blend all ingredients.Freeze for 4-5 hours, or use an ice cream maker.Enjoy your healthy, homemade treat!https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/youtube-videos-the-most-dangerous-ice-cream
