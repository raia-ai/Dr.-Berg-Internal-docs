# Are antibiotics generally safe for children?

Antibiotics given to children can potentially increase the risk of certain things later in life, such as: • Depression • Autism • Anxiety • ADHDWhat you can do: • Be sure the antibiotics are necessary • Make sure the child doesn’t consume foods that contain antibiotics (buy foods that are organic, grass-fed, and antibiotic-free) • If the child has to take an antibiotic, make sure they also take a probiotic at the same time, and after they stop taking the antibiotic • Allow the child’s immune system to learn from the environment • Keep key nutrients high (zinc, calcium, and vitamin D)https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/antibiotics-and-children
