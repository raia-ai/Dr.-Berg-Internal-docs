# At what age is it safe for a child to begin fasting?

When it comes to a child fasting, the age to start really depends on the child. Be sure never to proceed with a fasting plan prior to consulting their pediatrician. You may want to start your child on intermittent fasting if they are overweight. In this case, start them out by feeding them only three nutrient-dense meals a day and prohibiting snacking of any kind. Eventually you may be able to transition your child down to two meals a day, but be sure you follow a low-carb diet like keto and that the meals contain plenty of nutrients that growing children need, such as: DHA (omega-3 fatty acids), trace minerals, B vitamins, and vitamins C, D, and E.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-age-can-a-child-start-fasting
