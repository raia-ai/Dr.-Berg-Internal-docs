# What are the therapeutic benefits and clinical uses of hyperbaric oxygen therapy?

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is one of the most amazing therapies available. Oxygen therapy is very credible and has been thoroughly researched. When you breathe air, you’re normally getting only 21% actual oxygen. Oxygen therapy raises the oxygen to nearly 100%.Basically you are put in a pressurized closed environment so that the oxygen not only goes into your lungs but right into your tissues. It targets hypoxic areas, or areas that are deficient in oxygen. Basically, it drives a high amount of concentrated oxygen into injured tissues. It also has the capacity to stimulate stem cells by 800%.During hyperbaric therapy, you’re in the hyperbaric chamber for 1 to 2 hours, maybe 3 times a week, for several weeks.BenefitsGood for the following:DementiaStrokeHeart conditionsAsthmaEmphysemaAutoimmune conditionsBrain traumasCOPDCarbon dioxideAnemiaInflammation after injuryTumors, cancerPTSDHyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has a profound effect on DNA and genes.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-benefits-of-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy-hbot
