# How much weight can I expect to lose while fasting?

We’re talking about intermittent fasting alone, not with keto. Someone doing a health keto diet alone can lose around 2 lbs of fat per week if they have a healthy metabolism. But what about fasting?It is possible to lose 1/2 (.227 kg) lb per day while fasting. That’s 3.5 lbs (1.58 kg) per week. Keep in mind that these are in a best-case-scenario. You’re not going to lose more than this amount. If you’re just starting out, you might lose 7-15 lbs in the first week. This is mostly going to be water weight. Water stored in glycogen will release, which will cause you to get rid of a lot of water at first. There are 3-3.8 grams of water per gram of stored glucose (glycogen).Glycogen is like a fluid-filled sponge. When you fast, you use up the glycogen in your liver fairly quickly, which dumps a lot of water. There are many factors that play into how much weight you will lose while fasting, including: • Age • Activity level • Gender • Metabolism • Overall health • Diet • Stress level
