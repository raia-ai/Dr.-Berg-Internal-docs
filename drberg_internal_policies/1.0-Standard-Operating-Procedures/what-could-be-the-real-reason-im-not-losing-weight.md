# What could be the real reason I'm not losing weight?

If you're finding it difficult to lose weight quickly, there may be some overlooked factors at play. Insulin, a hormone crucial for blood sugar regulation, plays a significant role in metabolism. Ultra-processed foods, even those without added sugar, can negatively impact insulin due to their high starch content, leading to blood sugar spikes worse than sugar itself. Seed oils, stress, and lack of sleep can also disrupt insulin balance and hinder weight loss.To address insulin issues and promote weight loss:Reduce sugar and starch intakeAvoid snackingIncorporate exercise into your routinePrioritize getting sufficient sleepKeep in mind that achieving ketosis takes time and consistency. Even small indulgences can disrupt the process. If you're feeling less hungry and more energetic, it's a sign that your eating plan is working, and patience is key.Factors like overtraining, poor sleep, and certain medications can also impede weight loss progress.Consider these natural solutions to help lower insulin and accelerate weight loss:BerberineApple cider vinegar (1 tablespoon in water)Vitamin D (10,000 IU or 30 minutes of sunlight daily)Healthy Keto diet with intermittent fastingOnce you've adapted to a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, gradually increase the fasting window to 18:6 or even 23:1 for enhanced results.Dry fasting, abstaining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset for 12 hours, can also be a helpful tool for accelerating weight loss.https://www.youtube.com/embed/lFbFEzsKbzc
