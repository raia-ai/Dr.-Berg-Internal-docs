If you are deficient in vitamin B3, you can end up with pellagra. However, there’s also a subclinical version of this B3 deficiency. This is a situation where you have dermatitis—dry, brittle, scaly, and red skin. Vitamin B3 helps protect and restore your DNA, which results in your skin feeling and looking vibrant and healthy. Those with pellagra often consume too much corn, flour, rice, and alcohol. To fix this problem, people started adding synthetic vitamin B3 to enhance these foods.
