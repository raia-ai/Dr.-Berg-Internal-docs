# What are the best strategies to calm your mind before bed for better sleep and relaxation?

To calm your mind before bed, consider addressing the balance between your autonomic nervous system's sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) responses, which may be skewed by elevated cortisol levels. Vitamin B1 can be particularly effective in mitigating excessive problem-solving and mental activity that disrupts sleep. By increasing your intake of natural vitamin B1, you may help shift your system toward a more restful state, facilitating better sleep without intrusive thoughts.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/drink-1-cup-daily-to-bring-your-stress-to-zero
