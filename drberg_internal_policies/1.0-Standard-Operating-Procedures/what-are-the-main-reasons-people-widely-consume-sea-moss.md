# What are the main reasons people widely consume sea moss?

Sea moss and sea kelp are both types of seaweed that offer similar nutritional benefits. While sea moss has been used both topically and internally for skin health, digestion, and inflammation, its true strength lies in its rich mineral content.Sea moss boasts an abundance of nutrients, including amino acids, fiber, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and phytonutrients. However, it's the high concentration of trace minerals that sets it apart. These minerals, essential for our well-being but needed in small amounts, play a vital role in activating enzymes and proteins responsible for various bodily functions. For example, selenium is crucial for thyroid hormone conversion and immune support.Iodine is another key mineral found in sea moss, vital for thyroid health and hormone regulation. Unfortunately, most land-grown produce lacks these essential trace minerals, making sea moss and other sea vegetables valuable additions to our diet.While some seaweeds, including sea moss, contain carrageenan, a substance linked to digestive issues, it's important to differentiate between the naturally occurring form found in sea moss and the processed version added to some foods.Incorporating sea moss into your diet can be a simple way to boost your mineral intake and support your overall health.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/youtube-videos-why-sea-moss-is-going-viral
