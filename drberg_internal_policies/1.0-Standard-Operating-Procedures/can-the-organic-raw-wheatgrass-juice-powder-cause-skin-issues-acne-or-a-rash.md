# Can the Organic Raw Wheatgrass Juice Powder cause skin issues, acne, or a rash?

In some cases, yes. While acne and a mild rash may be undesirable, they result from one of the Organic Raw Wheatgrass Juice Powder's great benefits: detoxification.The liver filters toxins out of the body and keeps our blood clean. Over time, toxins can build up in the liver. Wheatgrass juice can help detoxify your liver by stimulating the production of enzymes that break down toxins.It's important to note that when your liver is detoxifying, it can cause some toxins to be released through the skin. This can lead to temporary skin irritation or acne. This signifies that your body is eliminating toxins and should clear up within a few days.Please see this video Dr. Berg created with the 12 Scientific Health Benefits of Wheatgrass Powder for more information - https://youtu.be/7W9BJpFMaa4?si=q3M-9Bw42LgZKiKe
