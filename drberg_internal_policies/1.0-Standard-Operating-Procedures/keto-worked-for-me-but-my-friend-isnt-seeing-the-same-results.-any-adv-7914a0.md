# Keto worked for me, but my friend isn't seeing the same results. Any advice to improve their outcomes?

Comparing results can overlook individual health histories, such as insulin resistance or hormonal changes like menopause. During the process of improving health, factors like increased muscle mass, reduced fat, and improved metabolic function can affect overall weight. Rather than focusing solely on weight loss, prioritize health, strength, and appetite control through deep ketosis. Building lean body mass can enhance calorie burning, especially with age-related declines in muscle mass and metabolism.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/why-your-friends-family-are-not-doing-keto-intermittent-fasting-drberg
