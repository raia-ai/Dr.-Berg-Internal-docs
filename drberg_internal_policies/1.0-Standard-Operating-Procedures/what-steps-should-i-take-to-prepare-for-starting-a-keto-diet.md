# What steps should I take to prepare for starting a keto diet?

When starting the ketogenic diet, your body goes through a short transition period of about two to five days as it shifts from burning carbs to fat. To ease this process, especially during stressful times, consider the following preparation tips:Preparing for Keto:- Take MCT oil to boost ketone production.- Remove junk food from your home.- Avoid restaurants without healthy options.- Meal plan and prep to stay on track.- Keep keto-friendly snacks on hand.You may experience symptoms like hunger and dizziness during adaptation, but sticking to the plan will help your body burn fat efficiently. Remember, ketosis is achieved by reducing carbs, not just increasing fat. Eating more fat can ease the transition, but you can lower fat intake once adapted.Preventing Keto Flu:To minimize discomfort:- Drink bulletproof coffee.- Add more fat to meals.- Use sea salt and electrolytes.- Take B vitamins (like nutritional yeast).The keto diet is generally safe for many, particularly those with obesity or type 2 diabetes. However, breastfeeding mothers should focus on nutrition rather than fasting, as deficiencies can harm both mother and baby.Health Awareness:Many people misjudge their health until they face issues. Recognizing early signs of health risks can help you use diets like keto as a preventive measure rather than just a reaction to problems.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/preparing-for-keto
