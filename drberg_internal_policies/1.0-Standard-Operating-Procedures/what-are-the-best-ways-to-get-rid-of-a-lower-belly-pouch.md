# What are the best ways to get rid of a lower belly pouch?

Many people do countless sit-ups thinking they will help, but they're still left with lower belly flab and looseness.The best belly pooch workout is actually reverse sit-ups. Reverse sit-ups are done by repeatedly extending the back while in a standing position. This can help flatten the lower belly and tighten the muscles and skin.To prevent lower back pain when starting reverse sit-ups, slowly increase the number of reps and the number of days you do this exercise each week. Make sure to really focus on tightening the butt muscles to help avoid lower back pain.Diet is just as important as exercise for a lower belly pooch. Do Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting, but focus on lowering your carbs down to 10 grams each day. This can really help target stubborn lower belly fat. It may also be helpful to cut down your fat intake until you achieve your desired fat loss.
