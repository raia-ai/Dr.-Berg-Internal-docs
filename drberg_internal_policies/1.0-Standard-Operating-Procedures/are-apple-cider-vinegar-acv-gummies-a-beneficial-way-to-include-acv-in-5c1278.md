# Are apple cider vinegar (ACV) gummies a beneficial way to include ACV in your diet?

A lot of different companies are coming out with these apple cider vinegar gummy bears or gummy supplements, but the formulas are very similar. While the claims are incredible, the products are not. In reality, these ACV gummy products are misleading and can even be damaging.The biggest problem with these apple cider vinegar gummies is the sugar content. They typically have three to five grams of sugar per serving size. One teaspoon of sugar is four grams. These apple cider vinegar supplements are not keto—they’re candy.These gummies will actually bump you out of ketosis. On top of that, they will leave you feeling bloated and tired. Instead of helping you lose weight, they’ll actually prevent weight loss. One serving size of apple cider vinegar gummies only contains about 500 mg of apple cider vinegar. An average serving size of liquid apple cider vinegar is 15 grams.This means that about one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar is equal to the whole bottle of apple cider vinegar gummies. A much better way to take apple cider vinegar is to mix liquid apple cider vinegar into water and drink it through a straw. I suggest using Fairchild’s Organic Apple Cider Vinegar. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/youtube-videos-are-keto-acv-apple-cider
