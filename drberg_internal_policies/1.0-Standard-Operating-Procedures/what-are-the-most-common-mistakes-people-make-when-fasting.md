# What are the most common mistakes people make when fasting?

Common mistakes when practicing fasting include transitioning too quickly before the body has adapted, unknowingly consuming too many carbohydrates, following plans like the 5-2 method (eating normally for five days and reducing calorie intake to a quarter for two days), and adhering to low-calorie, low-nutrient diets. Additionally, using low-quality ingredients, not getting enough potassium, B vitamins, or trace minerals, neglecting essential nutrients like B12, DHA, zinc, or iron on a vegan diet, and consuming low-fat foods can all impede progress.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/youtube-videos-the-top-7-errors-people-make
