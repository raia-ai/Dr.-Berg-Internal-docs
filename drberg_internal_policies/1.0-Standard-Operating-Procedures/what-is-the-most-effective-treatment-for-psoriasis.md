# What is the most effective treatment for psoriasis?

Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition – this is where your body creates antibodies that attack your own healthy tissue. With psoriasis, certain areas of your skin are replaced every 3 to 5 days instead of every 28 to 30 days. This accelerated production of skin cells is what causes the redness, scaliness and flakiness of psoriasis.Here are some ideas to help with psoriasis:Vitamin D – Vitamin D helps regulate T-cells. Vitamin D acts as a hormone in the body. In particular, it acts like cortisol, which is one of the primary treatments for psoriasis. This is why psoriasis cases skyrocket in the winter–most people get less vitamin D.Cod liver oil – Cod liver oil not only contains vitamin D and vitamin A, but it also has omega-3 fatty acids. Low levels of omega-3s are known to cause dry, scaly and red skin. Omega-3 is a powerful anti-inflammatory.Bile salts – Bile salts stimulate vitamin D receptors. This means that they allow vitamin D to work much better in the body.It’s also a good idea to go on an intermittent fasting plan and avoid all gluten.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/psoriasis-treatment-the-best-3-remedies-for-psoriasis-drberg
