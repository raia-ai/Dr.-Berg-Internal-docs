# What do you do when nothing works for weight loss?

The 3 dominating hormones that cancel out weight loss: 1. Cortisol Cortisol is a stress hormone activated by all forms of stress. In the presence of sustained cortisol, it will be hard to lose belly fat. It will also cause you to age more quickly, and it will even turn muscle into sugar. What to do: • Exercise • Get plenty of sleep • Consume B vitamins (nutritional yeast), calcium (not calcium carbonate), potassium (from vegetables) • Decrease stress from other people • Decrease physical stress • Increase pleasure 2. Insulin Insulin is a hormone that regulates the sugar in your blood. When you lose the ability to regulate sugar, the insulin goes up. Sugar triggers insulin. Even just a little bit of insulin can block fat burning. 3. Estrogen If you have problems with your menstrual cycle, you’re likely estrogen dominant. This will cause you to gain weight in your hips, butt, and below your belly button. It can also cause a fibroid, which then will make more estrogen. https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-to-do-when-nothing-works-for-weight-loss-drbergs-tips
