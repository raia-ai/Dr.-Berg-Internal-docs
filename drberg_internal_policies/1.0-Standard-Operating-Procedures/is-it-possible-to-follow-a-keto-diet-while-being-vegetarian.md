# Is it possible to follow a keto diet while being vegetarian?

Yes, of course. One of the challenges of a vegan keto diet is keeping carbs low, keeping protein high, and getting enough nutrients (B12, iron, vitamin A/D, trace minerals). Essential fatty acids are the main nutrients that those on a vegan ketogenic diet always seem to be deficient in.
