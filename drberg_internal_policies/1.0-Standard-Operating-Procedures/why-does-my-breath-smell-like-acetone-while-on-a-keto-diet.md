# Why does my breath smell like acetone while on a keto diet?

Acetone is one of the 3 types of ketones and is a normal byproduct of fat burning. If you notice that your breath smells like acetone, this means that your body is still adapting to fat burning. During keto adaptation, your body hasn’t fully adapted to using ketones as fuel, so the excess ketones are being excreted out of your body. This phenomenon is safe and also temporary.If you’re a type 1 diabetic and also experiencing acetone breath, consult with a health professional to ensure that you are not developing a condition known as ketoacidosis. If you aren’t a type 1 diabetic, this isn’t something you need to worry about.If you want to speed up the process of keto adaptation and get rid of acetone breath or keto breath, try these 4 tips:1.
