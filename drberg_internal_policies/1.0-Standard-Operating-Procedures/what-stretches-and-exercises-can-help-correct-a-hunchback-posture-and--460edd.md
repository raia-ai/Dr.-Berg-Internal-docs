# What stretches and exercises can help correct a hunchback posture and improve spinal alignment?

A person naturally has a fat pad on their back, but this isn't what we're talking about. Also, the C7 vertebra sticks out more than the rest, but this is normal.One more thing, a lipoma is a fatty tumor that can be on the back, creating the look of a hunchback, but that may need to be surgically removed.When you have really bad posture, and you're slouched, a ligament and muscles are too tight and are actually pulling you forward. If you try to sit up straight, it's like your stretching a rubber band that's going to go back exactly how it was.It may be much better to do the opposite. You don't want to sit up tall, stretching backward. You may want to try this stretch instead to potentially reverse hunchback posture. While sitting, try tucking your head forward as much as you can, slouch your upper back all the way down, and sit back up. Then repeat this 5-10 times once a day.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-to-fix-hunchback-with-the-correct-stretch-drberg
