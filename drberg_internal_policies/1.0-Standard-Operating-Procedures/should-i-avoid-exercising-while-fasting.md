# Should I avoid exercising while fasting?

Exercising while fasting can be beneficial, but it's important to assess how your body responds. If you maintain energy levels during workouts, you are likely adapted to using fat as fuel. However, if you're not yet adapted to ketosis, you may experience fatigue due to lower sugar availability.Your brain can efficiently use both ketones and glucose, so it doesn't require adaptation to ketosis. For those new to keto and experiencing side effects like headaches, incorporating MCT oil can help boost ketone levels and alleviate symptoms. Overall, if you can sustain your exercise performance while fasting, it can enhance the benefits of both fasting and physical activity.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/should-i-workout-while-i-am-fasting-drberg-answers
