# Can consuming sports drinks lead to fluid imbalance and unwanted weight gain?

When you think about a sports drink, the first thing that comes to mind is hydration and increased performance. However, the ingredients in most sports drinks could cause the exact opposite. In fact, many studies show that sports drinks do not help your performance at all.Hereâ€™s why. 1. Sugar dehydrates you because it depletes minerals. Sports drinks are filled with tons of sugar. Some of them have the same amount of sugar as a soda. This can cause even more dehydration. Gatorade contains 36 grams of sugar. 2. Sports drinks raise your insulin levels, which blocks fat burning and increases fat storage. 3. Insulin spikes and sugar crashes can make you tired. In turn, your performance may suffer significantly. 4. Sports drinks may lower your potassium, magnesium, and chromium. In summary, sports drinks are not good for hydrating you or losing weight. Instead, go with water or a keto-friendly sports drink with no sugar.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/can-sports-drinks-cause-dehydration-weight-gain-drberg
