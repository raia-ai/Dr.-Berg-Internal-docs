# Is it safe to follow a ketogenic diet during pregnancy or while breastfeeding?

During pregnancy, dietary changes should be approached carefully. A ketogenic diet can be beneficial, but strict fasting is not advisable. Instead, focus on a healthy ketogenic diet that prioritizes quality calories over just reducing carbohydrates.Additional carbohydrates are usually unnecessary, and nutrient-dense foods can help reduce the risk of diabetes and blood sugar issues. Proper nutrition is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as it supports the infant's immune system and may lower allergy risks.Always consult your healthcare provider before making dietary changes. While breastfeeding, infants can be in ketosis, which is natural. Studies suggesting negative effects often involve unhealthy formulas, while research shows that a well-structured ketogenic diet can be healthy for pregnant or breastfeeding women. In contrast, many infant formulas contain high levels of sugars and carbs, which may be less beneficial.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/keto-diet-and-pregnancy-is-it-safe-if-pregnant-or-breastfeeding-drberg
