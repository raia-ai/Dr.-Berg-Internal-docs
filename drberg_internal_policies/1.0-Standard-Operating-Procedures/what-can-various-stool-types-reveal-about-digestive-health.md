# What can various stool types reveal about digestive health?

1. Hard little round chunks This is a sign of too much protein. Cut back on protein and avoid high-protein products, like protein shakes and protein bars.2. Unformed flakes This is a sign of not enough enzymes. Many people who jump into a new diet have this problem. Take it slow so that your body has enough time to build up the right enzymes to break down your food.3. Floating stool This is a sign of a lack of bile. When your bile is low, your body doesnâ€™t fully digest fat. This leaves fat your stool, which floats in water.4. Skid marks This is a sign of a lack of pancreas enzymes. This will often accompany dark tarry stool. A digestive enzyme formula can help with this.5. Dry stool This is a sign of a lack of good gut bacteria. You can help fix this problem by consuming healthy probiotics.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/types-of-stool-size-shape-color-stool-analysis-by-drberg
