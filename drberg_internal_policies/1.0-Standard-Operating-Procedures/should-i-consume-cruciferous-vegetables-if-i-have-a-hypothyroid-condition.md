# Should I consume cruciferous vegetables if I have a Hypothyroid condition?

Cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli, cabbage, radish, bok choy, arugula, etc all tend to deplete or block the absorption of iodine. But the benefit of cruciferous far outweighs any negative.First of all, high estrogen can negatively affect the thyroid, so cruciferous helps balance estrogen, and secondly cruciferous vegetables also greatly help liver function. And the liver and gallbladder are important in the conversion of T4 to T3. To solve this problem, add high-quality sea kelp, which will give you a good source of iodine.*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/should-i-consume-cruciferous-vegetables-with-a-hypothyroid-condition-drberg
