# Why haven’t the anti-aging creams I’ve been using provided long-lasting results?

Understanding the Limits of Anti-Aging CreamsAnti-aging creams often offer only temporary benefits due to the fundamental biological processes underlying skin aging. Key factors include the natural decline in collagen and elastin production, primarily determined by genetics, which topical products cannot significantly alter. Additionally, oxidation and free radical damage contribute to aging, with antioxidants potentially mitigating this damage. However, the low concentrations of antioxidants in many creams may be insufficient for significant impact. A more effective approach is to consume antioxidants through a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and support natural antioxidant production through a healthy lifestyle.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-to-look-10-years-younger-anti-aging-hacks-drberg
