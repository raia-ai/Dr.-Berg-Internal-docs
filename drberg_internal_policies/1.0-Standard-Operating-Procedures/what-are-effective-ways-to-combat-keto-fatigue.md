# What are effective ways to combat keto fatigue?

Keto fatigue may be linked to sodium loss triggered by aldosterone, a hormone essential for survival that can lead to low sodium and potassium levels, resulting in fatigue and muscle cramps. Symptoms of low sodium include weakness, headaches, nausea, and restlessness, while elevated aldosterone levels can contribute to insomnia and high blood pressure. To alleviate these symptoms, it's recommended to consume 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of salt daily, particularly sea salt, which can help mitigate fatigue and symptoms of keto flu.During the initial phases of a ketogenic diet, significant water loss occurs, as high-carbohydrate diets typically promote water and sodium retention. Low blood pressure and lightheadedness may also indicate a lack of salt. Opting for sea salt, especially unrefined varieties like Himalayan pink sea salt, is advisable due to its numerous health benefits.
