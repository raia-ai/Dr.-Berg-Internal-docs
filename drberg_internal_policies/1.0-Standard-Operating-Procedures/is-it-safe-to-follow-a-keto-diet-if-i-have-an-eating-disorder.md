# Is it safe to follow a keto diet if I have an eating disorder?

When done correctly, Healthy KetoÂ® and intermittent fasting can elevate your mood and increase self-control. Many people with eating disorders consume high amounts of carbohydrates, leading to blood sugar issues that contribute to cognitive problems, anxiety, and depression. Low blood sugar can cause irritability and impulsiveness, making it difficult to stay present and make good decisions.Healthy Keto can improve your mood and reduce harmful impulses by stabilizing blood sugar levels. For best results, avoid calorie restriction, eat enough healthy fats, and aim for two meals a day without snacking. This approach helps you become leaner and healthier.*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/should-i-do-keto-intermittent-fasting-with-eating-disorders-drberg
