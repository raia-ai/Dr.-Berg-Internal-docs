# Does intermittent fasting raise cholesterol levels?

When you fast, your body mobilizes fat, releasing triglycerides and cholesterol. Triglycerides are used for energy, while cholesterol is used to make hormones, like testosterone and estrogen, and cortisol, an anti-inflammatory hormone. Cholesterol is essential for cell membranes and helps repair body damage, transported by proteins like LDL and HDL.During fasting, LDL and triglycerides usually drop, while HDL often increases, even if there's a temporary triglyceride spike. High cholesterol and triglycerides are mainly caused by high-carb foods, not fasting. Even if cholesterol is high after a fast, it is the good cholesterol (HDL) rather than LDL that comes from consuming carbs.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/why-do-you-get-high-cholesterol-after-intermittent-fasting-drberg
