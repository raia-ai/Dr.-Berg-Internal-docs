# How much Biotin Shampoo should I use when I wash my hair?

Massage a dime-sized amount of shampoo into your scalp and work through your hair until it’s fully coated. You can apply more product as needed. Rinse thoroughly when done. For best results, pair with Dr. Berg’s Biotin Conditioner after each use.
