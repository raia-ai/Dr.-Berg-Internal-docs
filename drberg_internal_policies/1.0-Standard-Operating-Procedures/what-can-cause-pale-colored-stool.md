# What can cause pale-colored stool?

Cause #1: Blockage or lack of bileIf bile is not being produced in the liver, or there is a blockage in the bile ducts to the intestines, these can result in loss of pigmentation in the gut, causing pale stool. So pale-colored stool could mean you have a blockage in the bile ducts, or your liver isnâ€™t producing bile, or there is a problem in your gallbladder.
