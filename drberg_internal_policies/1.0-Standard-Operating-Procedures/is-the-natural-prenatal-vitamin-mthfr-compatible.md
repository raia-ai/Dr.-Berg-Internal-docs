# Is the Natural Prenatal Vitamin MTHFR compatible?

Yes, we use calcium 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-Me-THF) an active form of folate, not folic acid, the inactive form the MTHFR gene enzymes cannot convert to the active form of folate. Studies have found that 5-Me-THF can enter the folate cycle directly, without the need for MTHFR gene enzymes.
