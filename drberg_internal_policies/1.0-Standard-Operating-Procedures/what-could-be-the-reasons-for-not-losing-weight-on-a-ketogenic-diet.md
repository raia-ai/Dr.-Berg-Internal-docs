# What could be the reasons for not losing weight on a ketogenic diet?

Dr. Berg notes that individuals in deep ketosis can still experience weight loss resistance due to insulin resistance, which slows metabolism. This can be influenced by two key factors: the amount of insulin triggered by the diet and the duration of insulin exposure.Common pitfalls that hinder weight loss on a ketogenic diet include:Frequent Eating: Prevents the body from fully entering ketosis.High Carbohydrate Intake: Disrupts ketosis.Partial Adherence: Inconsistent commitment reduces effectiveness.Sugar Alcohols: Can affect blood sugar and hinder weight loss.Stress and Lack of Sleep: Both disrupt metabolic processes and increase cravings.Excessive Fat or Protein Intake: May lead to caloric surplus.Calorie-Dense Foods: Dairy and nuts can contribute to weight gain.Starchy Vegetables: Interfere with ketosis.Certain Medications: May contribute to weight retention.Exercise Habits: Sedentary lifestyles hinder weight loss, while overtraining can lead to burnout.Key causes for slow or absent weight loss include:Eating too much fat.Slow metabolism.Severe insulin resistance.Tips for Succeeding on Keto:Focus on Fat: Keep carbs under 10 grams per day and avoid hidden carbs.Mind Your Eating Habits: Limit snacking and consider intermittent fasting to reduce insulin spikes.Adjust for Age: Those over 40 may benefit from one meal a day (OMAD).Understand Menopause: Keto can help rebuild muscle and address insulin resistance during menopause.Moderate Protein Intake: Limit to 3-6 ounces per meal, increasing to 8 ounces if very active.Prioritize Health: Focus on overall health improvements—energy, cognitive function, and sleep—to support weight loss.By implementing these strategies, you can improve your chances of weight loss while gaining health benefits from the ketogenic diet.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/not-losing-on-keto-see-9-reasons-why
