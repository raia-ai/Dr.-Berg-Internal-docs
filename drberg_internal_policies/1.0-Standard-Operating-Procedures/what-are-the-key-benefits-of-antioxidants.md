# What are the key benefits of antioxidants?

Antioxidants are molecules that fight free radicals in your body.What are free radicals?Most atoms are composed of electrons, protons and neutrons. Theyâ€™re the building blocks of the universe. Most atoms have paired electrons to balance each other out. A free radical is an atom that has unpaired electrons. That is, it has an electron on one side but not on the other side of the atom.Free radicals create damage to your cells, to the DNA and the mitochondria. They create a lot of oxidation, just like what happens to your car when it rusts. It can happen in your body too. Some of the examples of things that give off free radicals are radiation, certain chemicals, hydrogen peroxide, and free iron or free copper. Additionally, high levels of sugar create a lot of oxidation in your arteries and tissues.BenefitsCounter free radicalsReduce free radical damage to your bodyDifferent antioxidants:Vitamin EVitamin CZincSeleniumVitamin B1Lipoic acidUric acidhttps://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-are-antioxidants-and-free-radicals-drberg
