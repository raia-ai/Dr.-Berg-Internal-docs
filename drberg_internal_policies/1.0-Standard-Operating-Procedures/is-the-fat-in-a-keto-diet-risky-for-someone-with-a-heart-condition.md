# Is the fat in a keto diet risky for someone with a heart condition?

The issue lies not with fat, but with carbohydrates. It's crucial to reduce carbohydrate intake while maintaining the healthy fats naturally present in proteins. Additional fats are not necessary, but incorporating tocotrienols is beneficial for arterial health.Consider taking natto kinase, a natural fermented product effective in breaking down fibrin, a component of blood clots. It naturally thins the blood and is a powerful aid in maintaining clean arteries. The fats in a ketogenic diet are not harmful, provided they come from sources like grass-fed meats and are not accompanied by added sugars.Recent reports suggest that a "keto-like" diet may cause heart problems. However, this diet, which is high in both fats and carbohydrates, differs from the true ketogenic diet. The effectiveness of the ketogenic diet lies in its low carbohydrate content, not just its high fat content. Thus, the concerns about heart problems are misplaced when considering a properly followed ketogenic diet.*We recommend consulting with your doctor about any dietary changes if you have a medical condition.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/getting-right-amount-of-fat-on-keto-ketogenic-diet-drberg
