# What are the best strategies for managing adverse reactions to the flu vaccine?

For adverse reactions to the flu vaccine, consider high doses of vitamin C, starting with three grams daily and adjusting until the onset of diarrhea, then reducing the dose slightly. Additionally, 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 can help modulate the immune system and reduce inflammation. A good zinc supplement with trace minerals can also support the immune system. These steps aim to calm the overactive immune response triggered by the vaccine entering the bloodstream directly.
