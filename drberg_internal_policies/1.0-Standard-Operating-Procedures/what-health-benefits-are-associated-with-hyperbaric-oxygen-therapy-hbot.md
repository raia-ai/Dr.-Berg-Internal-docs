# What health benefits are associated with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)?

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT): A Powerful Treatment OptionHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment with a growing body of research supporting its use for various conditions. Here's what you need to know:What is HBOT?HBOT delivers nearly 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber. This is significantly higher than the 21% oxygen in the air we normally breathe.The increased pressure and oxygen concentration help deliver oxygen deep into tissues, especially those with reduced blood flow (hypoxic areas).HBOT can also stimulate stem cell activity, potentially aiding in tissue repair.How does HBOT work?Inside the hyperbaric chamber, patients typically breathe through a mask for 1-2 hours per session.Treatments may occur several times a week for a series of weeks.Potential Benefits of HBOTWhile research is ongoing, HBOT shows promise for treating:Brain Health: Conditions like dementia, stroke, and traumatic brain injury.Heart and Lung Health: Heart conditions, asthma, emphysema, COPD.Autoimmune Disorders: Exploration for benefits in managing inflammation.Other Conditions: Carbon monoxide poisoning, anemia, post-injury inflammation.Cellular Level: Research suggests positive effects on DNA, genes, and mitochondria. There is potential for use alongside cancer therapies.Mental Health: Preliminary exploration for its potential in addressing PTSD.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-benefits-of-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy-hbot
