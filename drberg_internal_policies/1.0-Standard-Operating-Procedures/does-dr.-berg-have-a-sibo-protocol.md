# Does Dr. Berg have a SIBO protocol?

To address SIBO from Dr. Berg’s perspective, the focus is primarily on starving off the excess bacteria by creating a digestive environment that’s less favorable to their growth. While he does not provide a set one-size-fits-all “SIBO protocol,” he emphasizes a multi-layered approach involving diet, intermittent fasting, and targeted supplements.The starting point is to reduce fermentable carbohydrates, especially sugars, grains, and starches, as these feed the bacteria in the small intestine. Dr. Berg recommends following a low-carb, Healthy Keto® plan that emphasizes non-starchy vegetables, high-quality proteins, and healthy fats while avoiding ultra-processed foods (UPFs). This naturally helps reduce the food supply for bacterial overgrowth.Dr. Berg acknowledges that a carnivore approach can offer short-term benefits, particularly in cases of SIBO or severe gut inflammation. Carnivore may help eliminate irritants and reduce fermentation by removing fiber-rich or fermentable foods that aggravate symptoms. However, this is typically viewed as a temporary therapeutic approach, not a long-term solution.Because high-fiber vegetables can sometimes worsen SIBO symptoms, individuals with SIBO or highly sensitive digestive systems may need to temporarily reduce fiber and fermentable veggies until the gut begins to heal. In such cases, lightly steamed, non-gassy, lower-FODMAP vegetables may be easier to tolerate.If you’re dealing with gut symptoms or SIBO, many people find it helpful to:• Begin with lower-vegetable or carnivore-like eating (short-term),• Slowly reintroduce non-fermentable vegetables as tolerated,• Transition into full Healthy Keto once digestion improves.In many cases, intermittent fasting can also be a powerful tool for improving gut motility and allowing the digestive system time to reset between meals. Even a 16:8 schedule (16 hours of fasting, 8-hour eating window) can support the cleansing waves of the small intestine known as the migrating motor complex (MMC), which helps sweep bacteria downward.To further support gut health, Dr. Berg often discusses these supplements:• Bile salts or ox bile help fat digestion and reduce stagnation in the small intestine.• Digestive enzymes help ensure complete digestion of food, limiting fermentation.• Berberine and oregano oil are natural compounds that may help reduce harmful microbes.More educational information on SIBO from Dr. Berg can be found in these videos: • “Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth(SIBO) Steals Your Nutrients” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOIjbB27enE • “How To Get Rid of SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth) With Intermittent Fasting” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkq_asOwBjU • “How to STOP Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth(SIBO)? – Dr. Berg” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQESlxQKIm8 • “Use Bile Salts for SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth)” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDGDC0fggKM
