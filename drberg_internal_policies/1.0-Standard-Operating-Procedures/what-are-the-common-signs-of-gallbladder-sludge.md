# What are the common signs of gallbladder sludge?

Gallbladder sludge is a collection of bile in the gallbladder that is unable to be released. This is because the bile stays in the gallbladder for too long. Gallbladder sludge can eventually cause stone formation in the bile ducts that go into your intestines.SymptomsStomach painNauseaRight shoulder painPain in the right scapulaPain under right rib cagePain in the mid back more on the right sideHeadache more on the right sideJaw pain more on the right sideBurpingBloatingCause #1: Low-fat dietBile is released from your body when you consume saturated fats.
