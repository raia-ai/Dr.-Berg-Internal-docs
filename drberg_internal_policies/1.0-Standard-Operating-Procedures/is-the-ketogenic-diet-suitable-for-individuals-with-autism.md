# Is the ketogenic diet suitable for individuals with autism?

A Healthy KetoÂ® diet could potentially improve communication skills, sociability, cognitive function, demeanor, and self-control in individuals with autism. The diet typically consists of 5% carbs, 20% protein, and 75% fat, with the addition of more fat (80 to 90%) and healthy ingredients for individuals with autism. Incorporating MCT oil, non-starchy vegetables, fatty meats, coconut oil, fatty fish, and electrolytes into the diet may be beneficial. Additionally, avoiding dairy, casein, gluten, and ghee might be advisable. Supplementation with electrolytes, B vitamins complex, and trace minerals is also recommended.*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-best-diet-for-autism
