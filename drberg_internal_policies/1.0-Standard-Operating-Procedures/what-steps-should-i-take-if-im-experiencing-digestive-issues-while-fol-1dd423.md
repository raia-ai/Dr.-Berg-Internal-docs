# What steps should I take if I'm experiencing digestive issues while following a ketogenic diet?

Managing Digestive Issues on the Keto DietWhen following a ketogenic diet, certain sugar substitutes, especially sugar alcohols, can cause digestive problems. Erythritol, xylitol, mannitol, and maltitol often lead to gastrointestinal discomfort. Reducing or eliminating these can help.High fiber intake from vegetables is recommended, but start with smaller amounts if you experience issues, as your gut may not be used to digesting large quantities. Fermented vegetables like sauerkraut or pickles can be easier to digest. Be cautious of keto-friendly products with corn fiber or inulin, which can also cause digestive disturbances.Focusing on whole foods and avoiding processed products with synthetic sugars like dextrose or maltodextrin is beneficial. Apple cider vinegar supports digestion, and intermittent fasting allows the digestive system to recover. Moderation is crucial with nuts, peanut butter, almond flour, and cheese.Addressing digestive issues on keto involves gradual adjustments, prioritizing whole foods, and mindful eating.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/resolve-digestive-stomach-problems-on-keto-diet-drberg
