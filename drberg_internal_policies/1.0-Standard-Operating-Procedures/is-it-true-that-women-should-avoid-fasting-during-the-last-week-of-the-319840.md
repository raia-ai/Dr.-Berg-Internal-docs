# Is it true that women should avoid fasting during the last week of their cycle to prevent disrupting hormonal function?

It's only true if you're nutrient deficient before, during, or after fasting. That's why it's crucial to supplement with electrolytes, B vitamins, omega-3, vitamin D, vitamin C, and trace minerals during fasting to prevent deficiencies that could impact your body's functions. Proper supplementation ensures a balanced approach to fasting and supports overall health during this period.
