A constant urge to urinate may stem from several underlying issues, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), elevated blood sugar levels, or kidney stones. If you suspect an enlarged prostate, adopting a Healthy KetoÂ® diet can be beneficial. It is advisable to avoid dairy products and incorporate pumpkin seeds into your diet.For urinary tract infections, consider remedies such as D-mannose, Kohki tea, and pumpkin seeds, which may help alleviate symptoms. Transitioning to a low-carbohydrate diet like Healthy Keto, combined with intermittent fasting, can be crucial for effectively addressing urinary issues and promoting overall urinary health.
