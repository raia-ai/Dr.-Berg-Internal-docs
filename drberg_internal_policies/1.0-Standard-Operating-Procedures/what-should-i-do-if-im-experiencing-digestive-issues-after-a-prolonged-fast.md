# What should I do if I'm experiencing digestive issues after a prolonged fast?

Sometimes, after breaking a prolonged fast, people experience digestive issues like diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea.During a fast, your digestive system goes on hiatus. When breaking a fast, you want to make sure you eat a very small amount of an easily digestible food like cooked vegetables or broth. Eating a large meal of the wrong food could cause many digestive problems. Among foods you should avoid temporarily after a long fast are nuts, nut butter, red meat, raw cruciferous vegetables, and dairy productshttps://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/digestive-issues-when-breaking-a-fastDr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D.Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do not encourage prolonged fasting.
