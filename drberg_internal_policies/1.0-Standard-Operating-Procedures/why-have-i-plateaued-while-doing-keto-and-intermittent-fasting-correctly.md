# Why have I plateaued while doing keto and intermittent fasting correctly?

When starting keto and intermittent fasting, initial water weight loss is common, but expect no more than two pounds per week after that. Focus on getting healthy first; weight loss will follow. Full commitment to keto means no cheat days or carb cycling. Success signs include improved energy, no cravings, and reduced hunger.Nine reasons for plateauing:1. Hidden Carbs: Check for hidden carbs in food and drinks.2. Fasting Pattern: Extend fasting periods or try OMAD (one meal a day).3. Bloating: Adjust vegetable intake, especially if you have SIBO.4. Fat Intake: Reduce dietary fat once fat-adapted.5. Exercise: Incorporate regular, intense workouts.6. Sleep: Ensure adequate sleep, adding extra if needed.7. Supplements: Use supplements like apple cider vinegar, potassium, vitamin B1, magnesium, and vitamin D.8. Stress: Manage or reduce stress.9. Health Conditions: Address any underlying health issues.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/plateau-on-keto-diet-intermittent-fasting-drberg
