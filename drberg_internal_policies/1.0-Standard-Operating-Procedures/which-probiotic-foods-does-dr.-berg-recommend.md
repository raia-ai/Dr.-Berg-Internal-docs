# Which probiotic foods does Dr. Berg recommend?

Kefir and sauerkraut are rich sources of diverse strains of friendly bacteria. Kefir, particularly organic grass-fed varieties, contains beneficial yeast and is low in lactose, making it suitable for those with lactose intolerance. Sauerkraut, when unpasteurized, offers probiotics along with fiber, vitamins C, K1, K2, U, potassium, and phytonutrients. Kimchi, another fermented food, provides unique strains of bacteria, along with vitamins C, K1, K2, potassium, and B vitamins. For probiotics from pickles, opt for lacto-fermented varieties kept unpasteurized in refrigeration or a root cellar to preserve their beneficial bacteria.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-best-probiotic-food-is-definitely-not-yogurt
