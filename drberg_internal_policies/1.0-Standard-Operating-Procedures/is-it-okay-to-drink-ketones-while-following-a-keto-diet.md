# Is it okay to drink ketones while following a keto diet?

I think the only reason I would do that is if I had some type of dementia or let's say I have seizures or if I wanted to raise my level of ketones up. Or if I'm going to exercise and get a little more energy.*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.
