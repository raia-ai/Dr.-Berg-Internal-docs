# Can I control where I lose fat?

Many women begin to lose the weight on their upper half first and then the lower half. So, is it possible to control where fat-burning occurs? Take a look. When you begin losing weight, your body starts to go after the intraabdominal fat first. This is the fat around your midsection. Next, you begin to burn the subcutaneous fat on the upper part of your body. Finally, you lose the fat on your lower bodyâ€”your hips and thighs. As a side note, the cellulite found on hips and thighs is only about 50% due to fat and 50% due to muscle atrophy. As you start losing fat in those areas, you also have to build muscle for the cellulite to go away. HIIT (high-intensity interval training) is great for toning up your body and losing weight. You also want to work on specific muscle groups, which can help if you have a personal trainer. Getting healthy and in-shape is about 85% dieting and 15% exercise. The healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting plan is by far the best way to get healthy and lose weight. It can take 6-8 months to really see results while losing weight. Be patient, and your body will thank you.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/can-women-control-their-weight-loss-weight-loss-tips-for-women-by-drberg
