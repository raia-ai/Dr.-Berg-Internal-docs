# How much magnesium does my body require?

The average American only consumes 200 to 300 mg of magnesium per day. But it’s Dr. Berg’s opinion that a person should consume more like 500 to 600 mg per day. Certain diseases, like diabetes, can cause the need for magnesium to go way up; this is because you likely aren’t retaining magnesium if you have blood sugar problems. Drinking a lot of alcohol can also severely decrease the ability to hold magnesium.Men need about 420 mg of magnesium per day. Women need about 320 mg of magnesium per day.Where to get itPumpkin seedsAvocadoLeafy greensNutsSpinachSwiss chardAlmondsDark chocolate (sugar-free)FruitGrainsPotatoBeansLegumesTofu (if you’re vegan and doing keto, some organic tofu may be fine)CashewsChardYou may want to avoid these versions of magnesiumMagnesium sulfateMagnesium carbonateMagnesium oxideMagnesium hydroxide
