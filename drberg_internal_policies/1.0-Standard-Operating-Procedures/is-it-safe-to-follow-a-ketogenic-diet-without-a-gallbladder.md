# Is it safe to follow a ketogenic diet without a gallbladder?

With the keto diet, 75% of your calories are coming from fat. The purpose of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate bile, which is the detergent that breaks down fats.Foods, especially fats, trigger the release of bile. Bile helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, etc. Without a gallbladder, you could have incomplete fat digestion or a deficiency in important fat-soluble vitamins. You could try taking Gallbladder Formula Extra Strength if you donâ€™t have a gallbladder, to get more purified bile salts. This could potentially help you have enough bile to support complete digestion. You may also want to do intermittent fasting along with the keto diet. *We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/can-i-do-a-ketogenic-diet-without-a-gallbladder-drberg-on-keto-diet-without-gallbladder
