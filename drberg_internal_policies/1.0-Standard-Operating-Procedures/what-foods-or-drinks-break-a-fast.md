# What foods or drinks break a fast?

When you’re fasting, you’re not eating anything. If you consume supplements that aren’t bone broth, amino acids, carbs, or shakes then you’re still fasting. Water also does not break a fast. If you’re taking vitamins and minerals you’re still fasting. It may not be a true fast, because a true fast is just water, but a fast without taking sea salt, electrolytes, and B vitamins can cause health issues and should not be attempted. Eating any kind of food will break your fast, especially foods high on the glycemic index. Likewise, drinking any liquid outside of water, especially drinks high in sugar, will also spike insulin levels and break your fast.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-breaks-a-fast-the-big-confusion-clarified-by-drberg
