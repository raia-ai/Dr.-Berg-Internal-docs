# What are some acceptable liquids to drink that won't affect my intermittent fasting or ketosis?

Unsweetened tea and coffee are fine, but you want to drink either one in moderation, 1 cup in the morning. You may add a little bit of heavy whipping cream but not too much.Too much caffeine can rev up the adrenals because it is a stimulant. It activates cortisol which can then activate insulin. Caffeine can also activate adrenaline, which does help fat burning, but don’t drink it to lose weight.If you add butter and make bulletproof coffee that would be considered as a meal. It would affect your keto and intermittent fasting.Water is good. Add some electrolytes to it, or salt, because being on the keto diet you will lose more water, salt and potassium.Bone broth is a really good thing to consume because you are getting a lot of electrolytes and nutrition without a lot of calories.Apple cider vinegar mixed with water is also very good. It assists with regulating blood sugars and helps if you have a fatty liver. It’s great for digestion, and improves glucose sensitivity so the need for insulin goes down.Unsweetened almond milk is okay because there’s usually not a lot of sugar in it.Lemon water is good to consume on keto. This will prevent kidney stones and uric acid stones from forming by alkalizing some parts of your body.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-should-you-drink-during-fasting-acceptable-liquids-drberg
