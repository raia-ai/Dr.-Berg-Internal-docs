# What are the main factors that contribute to the development of cataracts?

Cataracts, characterized by a clouded eye lens and potential vision loss, can be caused and managed as follows:1. Too-Alkaline Body Causing Calcium Deposits: - Cause: Excess body alkalinity can lead to calcium deposits in the eyes, forming cataracts. - Remedies: Use apple cider vinegar, betaine hydrochloride supplements, benfotiamine, and NAC drops.2. High-Carb Diet: - Cause: Excessive carb intake can deplete vitamin B1 and damage eye lens cells, similar to diabetic complications. - Remedies: Consume benfotiamine, NAC drops, adopt a Healthy KetoÂ® diet, and practice intermittent fasting.3. Other Causes: - Aging, stress, and medications like prednisone can also contribute to cataract development.Addressing these factors through dietary adjustments, supplements, and lifestyle changes can help manage cataracts and support eye health. Regular medical advice is recommended for personalized care.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-causes-cataracts-drberg
