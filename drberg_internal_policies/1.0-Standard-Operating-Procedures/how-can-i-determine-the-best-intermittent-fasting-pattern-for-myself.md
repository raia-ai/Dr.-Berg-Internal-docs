# How can I determine the best intermittent fasting pattern for myself?

The best intermittent fasting pattern varies heavily by person. While some are content fasting 20 hours and eating only 4 hours, other people are more comfortable fasting for 16 hours and eating during an 8-hour window. The best way to find your optimal fasting pattern is to start slowly and expand your fasting window as much as possible over time until you feel you have reached an easy-to-maintain pattern.It is also helpful to make sure you do not eat if you aren't hungry, even if you are inside your eating window. Additionally, make sure when you do eat, it is nutrient-rich food, with sufficient protein and healthy fats so that you feel satiated during your fast.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-to-figure-out-your-intermittent-fasting-pattern-drberg
