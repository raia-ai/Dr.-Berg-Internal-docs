# Is it safe to take probiotics and prebiotics together?

Taking prebiotics and probiotics together is safe, and they may even work best when combined. Prebiotics are plant-based fibers that act as a nutrient source for the growth of healthy bacteria within the digestive tract. Probiotics contain beneficial bacteria that aid in food digestion and promote gut health. The combination of prebiotics and probiotics is known as synbiotic or microbiome therapy. Some foods are naturally synbiotic, such as kimchi, tempeh, miso, kefir, fermented pickles, and sauerkraut.
