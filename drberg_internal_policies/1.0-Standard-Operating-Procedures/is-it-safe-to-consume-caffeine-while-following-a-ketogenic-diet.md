# Is it safe to consume caffeine while following a ketogenic diet?

One small coffee is fine. However coffee is the 3rd most sprayed crop in the world so it is always us organic. Also if you put cream in it - use grass-fed cream. If you sweeten it, add xylitol (non-GMO). Decaffeinated: used water filtered because this too could add more chemicals. Adding too much coffee can stimulate the adrenals to add more cortisol thus slowing your ketosis.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/is-coffee-okay-on-keto-drberg-on-caffeine-ketosis
