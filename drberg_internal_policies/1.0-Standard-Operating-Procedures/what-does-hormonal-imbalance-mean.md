# What does hormonal imbalance mean?

Understanding Hormonal Imbalances: Beyond Tests and SymptomsHormone tests can be misleading. Significant issues need to be present for an imbalance to appear on a test. This is particularly true for the adrenal glands, where up to 90% dysfunction may be needed to show a problem. Even 'normal' test results and a lack of obvious symptoms don't mean you're in perfect health.Identify the root cause, not just the symptom. Treating hormone imbalances without understanding the underlying cause is a missed opportunity. Hormones are the body's messengers, and their production is controlled by glands. These glands are often the root of the problem and should be the focus.What causes hormonal imbalances?Think of hormones as communication signals. Glands produce hormones, send them, and receive feedback. Neglecting the health of the gland can create widespread imbalances.What can I do for hormonal imbalance?Ask "why" not just "what". Focus on the underlying cause instead of simply replacing the hormone. Taking external hormones can sometimes lead to glands becoming less active.Support your glands. Good nutrition and even techniques like acupressure can be beneficial in supporting gland health.Key takeaway: Hormonal health is complex. Don't rely solely on tests or treating symptoms in isolation; prioritize identifying and addressing the root cause.
