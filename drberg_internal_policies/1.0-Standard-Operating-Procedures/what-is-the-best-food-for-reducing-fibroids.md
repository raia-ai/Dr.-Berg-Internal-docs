# What is the best food for reducing fibroids?

A fibroid is a tumor that’s growing on the inside of the uterus or different parts of the uterus. It could be between the size of a pea and the size of a basketball.A person with a fibroid may want to avoid foods that cause growth and anything that increases estrogen, such as cheese, soy, and flax. Insulin is also a powerful growth hormone, so it’s important to go on a low-carb, low-sugar diet.However, there are foods that have various phytonutrients and may actually help decrease inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis (the formation of new blood supply to a fibroid).The best foods for fibroids:1. Berries (ellagic acid)2. Garlic (allicin)3. Cauliflower (indole-3-carbinol)4. Tomato (lycopene)5. Onion (quercetin)6. Broccoli sprouts (sulforaphane)7. Peppermint (ursolic acid)8. Shallots (isoliquiritigenin)9. Peanuts (resveratrol)Intermittent fasting may also be a few of the most important things you can do to potentially shrink fibroids. Overall, combining Healthy Keto & Intermittent Fasting along with some of the foods above may be a great plan.*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-best-foods-to-shrink-fibroids
