We’ve partnered with Global-E to offer a seamless shopping experience for our international customers. Global-E helps make your shopping easy by allowing you to:

Shop in your local currency – No need for conversion calculations. Prices are displayed in your preferred currency. Please note that the shipping address determines which currency you will be charged.
Pay taxes and duties at checkout – Say goodbye to surprise fees upon delivery. All taxes and import duties are calculated and paid during checkout, so no extra charges show up later.
Multiple payment options – You can use your preferred payment methods, from credit cards to local options, for a smoother transaction.
Duties and taxes are calculated based on the items ordered, shipment destination, and the value of the purchase. If duties and taxes are charged at checkout, they will appear as a separate line item. If they are already included in the product price, there will be a note at checkout clarifying. Some countries require duties and taxes to be paid upon delivery, and they will be the customer's responsibility. It will be noted at checkout for full transparency before you order.

Please select the country switcher dropdown to see which countries we ship to and select accordingly.
